ALLIANCE, Ohio – For customers that are looking for an effortless way to remove shedding hair from their pet's coat, our Safari® by Coastal line has several options. The newest addition is the Grooming Mitt and Glove. The left right design mitt can be used for wet or dry grooming and is specifically designed to trap loose hair. The glove, which is a nice option for petting, removes debris from the coat and promotes a stress-free grooming process. Pet grooming is important for the health and cleanliness of dogs and other pets. Grooming removes excess hair, which can prevent hairballs and skin irritation, and keep the pet smelling fresh. Grooming can also improve the quality of the coat and skin, increase blood circulation, and remove fleas. Dealing with pet shedding can be a challenge for any pet owner. Not only is it time-consuming to clean up, but it can also be frustrating when hair gets everywhere - on the clothes, in the workspace, and all over the furniture. Luckily, there are a few things one can do to help manage the shedding and make life a little easier. The Grooming Mitt and Glove are devised particularly to help with this problem. They quickly and efficiently remove shedding hair from both dogs and cats.

MSRP starts at $9.49 for collars and $19.49 for leashes. Soy fabric is an eco-friendly fabric made from the hulls of Soy beans. Soy protein is liquefied and then extruded into long, thin filament fibers that are then cut and processed similar to many other natural fibers. The protein is taken from the waste of food production, rather than harvesting the Soy beans especially for this purpose, meaning that nothing is waste. New Earth® Soy Adjustable Collar

• Soft, cashmere feel
• Anti-bacterial properties to control odor It gets better with age! While most collars wear out, get stinky or fall apart over time, leather collars actually get better with age. The leather takes in natural oils that enrich the color and causes the collars and leashes to become softer and more pliable over time. Leather leashes are a favorite with trainers, because they don't slip or cause the painful brush burns that can happen from using nylon or polyester training leads. A legacy reputation dog trainers trust The full grain, top quality leather is sourced from a company that's been specializing in leather for over 150 years. Hides are are drum dyed for consistent color saturation and the vegetable tanning method carefully processes the leather, creating a superior character in the final product. Moreover, vegetable tanning is a natural and eco-friendly process that uses a blend of tannins that includes the bark of Mimosa and Quebracho trees. The process is labor-intensive and can take up to six weeks to complete. Created for those woh love the outdoor lifestyle, Water & Woods is perfect for anyone with hunting and retriever dogs, as well as for camo enthusiasts. The new collars and leashes feature Mossy Oak out door & lifestyle patterns, matte gunmetal hardware, and a quick-release Alligator Snap on the leashes.

The glove, which is a nice option for petting, removes debris from the coat and promotes a stress-free grooming process. Pet grooming is important for the health and cleanliness of dogs and other pets. Grooming removes excess hair, which can prevent hairballs and skin irritation, and keep the pet smelling fresh. Grooming can also improve the quality of the coat and skin, increase blood circulation, and remove fleas. Dealing with pet shedding can be a challenge for any pet owner. Not only is it time-consuming to clean up, but it can also be frustrating when hair gets everywhere - on the clothes, in the workspace, and all over the furniture.

They quickly and efficiently remove shedding hair from both dogs and cats.

It is designed with specific selected Velcro that is strong and quieter when opening. The snug fit helps reduce the anxiety the cat could get when heading outdoors.

The wide chest strap also helps alleviate some of the stress that a cat could experience from the harness. It distributes the weight evenly over their torso, making it easier for them to adjust to a new walking system. The harness comes with a 6’ leash and is designed for all sizes, ranging from small to large cats. The harness, available in grey, is super soft and comfortable for cats to wear.

Soy protein is liquefied and then extruded into long, thin filament fibers that are then cut and processed similar to many other natural fibers. The protein is taken from the waste of food production, rather than harvesting the Soy beans especially for this purpose, meaning that nothing is waste. New Earth® Soy Adjustable Collar

• Perfect for dogs with sensitive skin New Earth® Soy Leash
• Soft, cashmere feel
• Anti-bacterial properties to control odor It gets better with age! While most collars wear out, get stinky or fall apart over time, leather collars actually get better with age. The leather takes in natural oils that enrich the color and causes the collars and leashes to become softer and more pliable over time. Leather leashes are a favorite with trainers, because they don't slip or cause the painful brush burns that can happen from using nylon or polyester training leads. A legacy reputation dog trainers trust The full grain, top quality leather is sourced from a company that's been specializing in leather for over 150 years. Hides are are drum dyed for consistent color saturation and the vegetable tanning method carefully processes the leather, creating a superior character in the final product. Moreover, vegetable tanning is a natural and eco-friendly process that uses a blend of tannins that includes the bark of Mimosa and Quebracho trees. The process is labor-intensive and can take up to six weeks to complete. Created for those woh love the outdoor lifestyle, Water & Woods is perfect for anyone with hunting and retriever dogs, as well as for camo enthusiasts. The new collars and leashes feature Mossy Oak out door & lifestyle patterns, matte gunmetal hardware, and a quick-release Alligator Snap on the leashes. Training dummies and foam trainers are designed to promote an easier grip.  Alongside the shape, their texture and construction provide a strong hold. When your dog's personality is too big for a plain, thin collar, the Sublime® Adjustable Dog Collar is the perfect choice. These wider-than-average collars feature two-sided complementary patterns for a unique look you'll love. And the durable plastic buckle holds up to the everyday wear a big dog puts it through.

When dogs interact with the PupPod Rocker at the correct time, they earn food rewards from a connected feeder and the game gets harder as dogs gets smarter. Dogs can work for 30 min to over an hour to earn a normal meal. The entire game is controlled from a smartphone where people can change game settings and stream live video. The entire game is based on operant conditioning and positive reinforcement. At first, dogs are rewarded for learning the connection between the PupPod Rocker and feeder. Then the game gets harder, requiring dogs to touch the toy within 2-seconds of a reward sound. There are game levels to reinforce concentration, task discrimination and impulse control. PupPod is accessible to deaf, hearing impaired, and blind dogs. The mental stimulation can help reduce separation anxiety and lead to calm behavior. Spread the Rocker and feeder apart to turn meal time into an activity. Dogs can walk up to a mile while earning a normal meal. It’s a great indoor activity when the weather outside is too hot, cold, icy or snowy. PupPod encourages slow eating which is better for health and digestion."

Tonisity Inc. Launches New Pet Hydration Products and More at SuperZoo Learn more at a special Media Happy Hour, on August 24 from 3 to 5 p.m. at Booth 7557 (Saint Joseph, Mo. July 22, 2022) — It’s the dog days of summer and with the country’s record heat waves, hydration has never been more important for cats and dogs. During this time of year dry pet food just isn’t enough. It often lacks the digestive enzymes that are found in raw foods, doesn’t have much variety, and often contains lots of grain that many pets can’t handle. But Tonisity Inc. is pleased to announce the additions of several new products in their highly successful DoggyRade, KittyRade, and YummyRade brand lines. The new hydration products will be unveiled August 23-25 at this year’s SuperZoo trade show at the Mandalay Bay Convention Center in Las Vegas. Attendees will have the first opportunity to check out Tonisity’s newest products, some of which will also be featured at the show’s New Product Showcase: All products are centered around prebiotics, which is essential to gut health and hydration. Prebiotics are the nourishment that promotes the growth of beneficial microorganisms in the intestines and feed the probiotics, which are foods or supplements that contain live microorganisms intended to maintain or improve the “good” bacteria in a pet’s gut. Hydration is critical to a pet’s health, as it regulates body temperature, lubricates joints, improves cognitive function, and cushions an animal’s brain and spinal cord. In studies done, DoggyRade dogs drink up to five times more water than pups that are offered only water. This special drink is highly palatable and ready to use on-the-go. Cats are notorious for not drinking enough water. If they don’t drink enough fluids, that can lead to potential health issues. In fact, one in three cats experiences some form of kidney disease, which often correlates to a lack of fluid intake. In company studies, KittyRade cats drank nine times more than regular water! YummyRade is a low-fat, low-calorie meal enhancer to improve the taste and palatability of pet food. It contains prebiotics to support good gut health.

They're high in protein and low on carbs making them ideal for dogs, and lastly, the Himalayan connection brings rare minerals along with all organic alternatives to the processed treats. The cheese treats are a new concept in India. Dogsee was the pioneer in introducing Himalayan Cheese Treats to India. The dog treat brand has 4 facilities in Karnataka and has vowed to offer employment to 400 workers this year. One of the largest dog treats brands in the country, Dogsee, recently implemented Solar Energy in their facilities and became a carbon-negative  brand. The facility has achieved a net negative emission status and will continue to walk down the sustainable path with the help of a solar energy backing installed at the plant unit. The pivot towards sustainability comes in the light of the company's resolution to be the most ethical and ecological brand in the pet sector that not only caters to the well-being of pets but to the overall environment as well. The leadership at Dogsee aims to be a carbon-negative organization across all premises by the end of 2022. Sneh Sharma, Co-founder, of Dogsee states, “Our roots are intrinsically connected with nature and its forever generosity. It is only fitting that we do our bit for Mother Nature while ensuring that we offer the best of services and products. While expansion and  scalability have always been our aim, we intend to do this organically and more sustainably - hence our efforts to build net carbon factories that will run on solar energy. We are proud to establish one such unit and are working fervently towards making all our production and packaging units carbon-free by the end of the year”. The ecological ethos led the third factory has the production and processing capacity of the production of 100 tons Himalayan Chews every month, scaling it to 500 tons a month by the end of this fiscal year. The vision also includes new product lines comprising five Dogsee products this year in treats, cookies, and grooming range. The mission of increasing its product scalability is to build a one-stop platform for everything under pet care. In addition to being a completely sustainable unit by the end of the year, Dogsee also aims to enhance its workforce and hire 400 employees this year. With the increase in workforce and products, Dogsee envisions scaling its 1500 stores to 5000 stores in India, and 10k stores to 100k stores overseas by the end of the year. Dogsee, India’s fastest growing natural pet treat brand, has raised $7 Million in pre-series A round from Six Senses Ventures in November '21 and $5.6 Million in Series A funding round from Mankind Pharma in January '22. This marks Mankind Pharma’s entry into the pet food category. Founded by the husband-wife duo Bhupendra Khanal and Sneh Sharma, Dogsee is the only company to offer 100% vegetarian dog treats. The young company is taking on the rawhide treat industry, which they believe is extremely harmful to the dogs with all the added preservatives and chemicals. Dogsee treats, in comparison, are all-natural, human-grade, and protein-rich which have made them a huge success in the pet parents’ community globally. Dogsee is now India’s 5th largest pet food exporter and is loved by pet parents in more than 30 countries. Talking about the investment, Dogsee founder Bhupendra Khanal said, “Our products are the result of years of careful research focused on the precise nutritional needs of dogs. We put research and innovation at the heart of everything we do. The more we understand, the better placed we are to make a positive difference in the health and well-being of pets. Mankind Pharma has an established history of creating highly successful consumer products. Having the backing of such a giant is a huge vote of confidence for us and we look forward to learning from their expertise.” Sneh Sharma, Dogsee co-founder mentioned, “With Mankind, we share the common DNA of innovation. We are confident that with their support, we will be able to develop the niche that we have envisioned for the brand.” She also added, “Sixth Sense Ventures has been a great partner for us. We are excited to be deepening our partnership with this round. It speaks a lot about the trust and comfort we have established between us in such a short span of time.” The investment will primarily be used towards brand building, R&D, and building a strong distribution network. Speaking of their investment in Dogsee, Mr. Arjun Juneja Chief Operations Officer of Mankind Pharma said, “The trust that people have shown in Dogsee has strengthened our confidence to invest in a brand that is true to its nature. Mankind has always believed in innovation and, with brands like Dogsee that are innovative & young, we see the future of India.” Nikhil Vora, Founder & CEO of Sixth Sense Ventures added, “With their 100% Natural & Vegetarian offerings, Dogsee is uniquely positioned to make the most of the current global trends in the pet care industry. We are excited to deepen our partnership with Sneh and Bhupi and are elated to be part of their journey.” Dogsee has also been the winner of ETRise awards 2021 and was awarded the Brand of the Year in the Pet Meals and Treats category at the prestigious Channelier FMCG Awards 2021."

Durkha Chews are natural, long-lasting, non-staining, odorless, and grain & gluten-free! There is no better alternative to rawhide.","Durkha Chews are made using an ancient Himalayan recipe of Yak and/or Cow milk that is dried and hardened to form a delicious cheese snack for dogs. They are 100% natural, long-lasting, non-staining, odorless, and grain & gluten-free! There is no better alternative to rawhide. (PRESS RELEASE)Yak Cheese Chews were first introduced to the pet care industry in 2003. In 2022, Durkha Dog Chew in Kent, WA, and Kukuje GmbH in Hamburg, Germany, teamed up to reinvent the Cheese Chew. Dogs and dog parents love Yak Cheese Chews because they are long-lasting, grain, and gluten-free, and a healthy alternative to Rawhides. Whereas Rawhide cannot be broken down in a dog’s stomach and can swell and cause blockages, Cheese Chews are 100% natural and are only made with cheese and lime, and are easy for dogs to digest. When COVID shut down a majority of the world in 2020, Neil Pokharel, CEO at Durkha Dog Chew, connected with Narendra Shrestha, managing director at Kukuje GmbH in Germany. With Neil’s product development strategy and Narendra’s skills in cheese making stemming from being a third-generation member of a family that had the art and experience in the cheese making process, they set out to producing Yak Cheese Chews in Germany with the artisanal cheese craftmanship while using modern machinery. Two years later, Durkha and Kukuje partnered, and they now have the best quality Cheese Chews made with 100% pristine cow’s milk from Germany. These Cheese Chews are identical to Yak Cheese Chews from Nepal. Introduced to the U.S. market in 2021, Cheese Chews have been exactly what the pet industry market and consumers have been searching for in a quality Cheese Chew. “I had a vision of a healthy Cheese Chews for our fur babies across the globe and that vision was turned into a reality when I met Narendra,” says Neil Pokharel, CEO at Durkha. “With his high-level commitment towards quality and his precision towards creating a perfect product, we now can proudly share the news that we have the Cheese Chews for our customers that no one in the industry has.” Mud Bay, pioneers in natural pet care, has partnered with Neil and Durkha Dog Chew for many years. “We appreciate the ease of working with him in addition to the high quality of products they produce,” says the director of Mud Bay “Our trust in their transparency and quality of products is the reason we have partnered for many years on both Durkha branded treats in addition to partnering on private-label goods. We appreciate this partnership and look forward to its growth.” “With a high demand for quality Cheese Chews for companies and consumers in the US and around the globe, I had to use generations-old Cheese Chew making experience that was passed on to me from my family,” states Narendra Shrestha, Kukuje GmbH managing director “We are the only company outside of Nepal that has been successful in preserving the actual texture of the original Yak Cheese Chew from Nepal while still creating a healthy Cheese Chews that represents the Nepali art and the cheese-making traditions. This is something that has never been done before outside of Nepal.” Both the Traditional Cheese Chews and the Premium Quality Cheese Chews are offered for purchase. Whether you are looking to purchase the Traditional Cheese Chews directly from Nepal/US or our Premium Chews from Germany/US, stop by Booth #1881 at SuperZoo.

Founded by veterinarian Bob Goldstein and his wife, Susan, Earth Animal is pioneering a more humane and sustainable way of enhancing and preserving quality of life for animals, people, and the Earth. We source our catfish from the Chesapeake Bay where this non-native catfish species was introduced for recreational fishing in the 1960s. The species proved to have a higher tolerance to salinity leading to an overabundance. Today, catfish is considered an invasive species with many people, businesses, and organizations working together to manage the crisis. Fortunately for both humans and animals, blue catfish is both very tasty and nutritious. Using these fish in our diets is helping to clean up the waters and rebound native fish populations in the Chesapeake Bay – allowing a piece of the Earth’s natural ecosystem to heal. Also, sourcing catfish provides an opportunity for fishermen to earn an income from the invasive species that threaten their livelihoods. Non-native species outcompete native populations and disrupt the balanced food chain. No-Hide® is the original super-healthy, longer-lasting, and mind-blowingly tasty alternative to rawhide. By combining a healthy formula, high quality ingredients, and compassionate sourcing, No-Hide chews are offering dogs worldwide pure joy. There’s no-thing like it on Earth."

MIAMI (August 11, 2022) – When consumers purchase raw pet food for their furry friends, they want to make sure the product contains natural ingredients, with no additives or preservatives. That’s why Steve’s Real Food uses high pressure processing (HPP) in the manufacture of its raw pet food. HPP is a non-thermal food preservation process that uses cold water and high pressure to inactivate foodborne pathogens. In addition, it keeps the food’s organoleptic and nutritional properties intact, without preservatives, and extends shelf life. Steve’s Real Food has been a pioneer of the raw pet food diet as the first commercial raw brand on the market in 1998. Its products are produced with locally sourced, free-range meat and poultry without antibiotics or hormones. In 2011, Steve’s Real Food was searching for a solution to comply with stricter food safety regulations while using only natural ingredients without preservatives. The company used a test and hold process for foodborne pathogens, but it proved insufficient. It also needed to prevent cross-contamination in the production of meat and poultry. “We tested acid sprays, biophages, test and hold, probiotic sprays, and environmental controls,” said Nicole Lindsley, Owner, Steve’s Real Food. “None of them could produce our goal of a 5-log reduction.” Steve’s then turned to Hiperbaric, the world’s leading manufacturer of HPP equipment. With the help of HPP, Steve’s Real Food keeps their pet food safe while using only natural ingredients without preservatives. The $11 million business is growing, thanks to HPP’s shelf-life extension that has enabled them to sell their products to independent retailers nationwide, and open new markets in South Korea and China. Today, Lindsley is an HPP advocate, conducting consumer awareness efforts to educate pet owners, veterinarians and retailers about the benefits of HPP. Additionally, Steve’s has participated in Hiperbaric webinars, as well as presentations at industry conferences, with Dr. Vinicio Serment-Moreno, Applications & Food Processing Specialist.

Miami (August 17, 2022) - Hiperbaric, the world leader in supplying high pressure processing (HPP) equipment for the human and pet food industry, recently shared insights into the risks and safety of raw pet food diets. Raw pet food poses a health risk for pets and humans as it can be contaminated with pathogenic bacteria. High pressure processing, or HPP, is an excellent method to inactivate these food-borne pathogens while maintaining the nutritional integrity of the food. HPP is a nonthermal process applying water and high pressure to products in their final packaging to eliminate foodborne bacteria, promote clean labels, maintain nutrition and taste, and extend shelf life. Many myths surround HPP pet food, including nutrient degradation, enzyme inactivation, or inefficient pathogen control. Hiperbaric explains the facts. Is there a risk of raw pet food being unsafe for pets and pet owners? Pet diets based in raw meat products present several benefits, such as improved nutrition, healthier/regular digestion, cleaner teeth, shinier coat and relief from food allergies/sensitivities. However, raw pet food poses a health risk for both animals and humans since it can be contaminated with food-borne pathogens. Although pets can be more tolerant to some bacteria, they are not completely immune. In addition, food-borne pathogen transmission from pet to owner is possible through the pet’s mouth, fur, skin, or any body part that comes in contact with contaminated saliva or feces. Additionally, the owner may inadvertently spread pathogens through kitchen surfaces or appliances by handling the raw pet food, risking cross-contamination if not properly sanitized. Methods such as HPP will eliminate this risk by inactivating bacteria. What is the effect of HPP on pet food? The “Steve’s Real Food’s Study of High-Pressure Processing on Raw Meat Diets” reports the effects of HPP on 95 vitamins, proteins, essential amino acids, fats, and fiber. The results showed that HPP did not alter the concentration of the analyzed components, as the change percentage remained between –1% and 1%. Only 4 out of the 95 tested components presented a slight decrease following HPP. What is the shelf-life of HPP pet food? Is it compatible with other pet food interventions like freezing, freeze-drying and fermentation? In addition to food safety, HPP allows shelf-life extension by slowing the growth of spoilage microorganisms like yeasts and molds. This achieves between 14-35 days of shelf-life in refrigerated storage, compared to 7-10 days of unprocessed products. Bacteria and other microorganisms adapt to different unfavorable environments and might survive freezing, freeze-drying, or fermentation. Applying HPP acts as a “kill step” for food-borne pathogens. Cold storage (refrigeration, freezing) or freeze-drying further minimizes the risk and extends shelf-life. For example, the combination of HPP and freezing yields up to 2 years of shelf life. Freeze-drying also achieves up to 2 years of shelf life and allows ambient temperature storage. Does HPP eliminate all fooborne bacteria? HPP does not eliminate bacterial spores. What about probiotic bacteria? Various species of lactic acid bacteria considered as probiotics are resistant to high pressure. Does HPP change the color of meat? HPP induces a “cooked-like” appearance in uncooked pet foods, while most of the nutrients remain unchanged. The color change is related to slight structural changes, but the nutritional value of the protein and its amino acid sequence remain intact. The inclusion of natural ingredients such as beets or grape pomace improves the red color of HPP meat. Which pet food companies are using HPP? HPP pet food has earned the trust and acceptance of pet owners and pets, making pet food companies more confident in switching to HPP. Companies that use HPP include Balanced Blends, Instinct, Kiwi Kitchens, Petkis, Primal Pet Foods, and Steve’s Real Food, among others. Hiperbaric will exhibit at Super Zoo Aug. 23-25 in Las Vegas.

Miami (August 17, 2022) – High Pressure Processing (HPP) has been widely reported to retain the nutritional and sensory impact of raw pet food. HPP, a food preservation method, minimizes risks associated with common foodborne pathogens. Hiperbaric, the world leader in supplying high pressure processing (HPP) equipment for the human and pet food industry, works with pet food processors and other agencies to assess the impact of HPP on raw pet food. In addition to safety and nutrition, HPP enables pet food to be commercialized as fresh, frozen, and freeze-dried foods in minced mixtures, chubs, kibbles, raw meaty bones, and many more forms. Clinical Studies of HPP Raw Pet Food Formulation Clinical studies have shown that HPP is safe for pets. Bulgarian researchers Neshovksa, Shindarksa and Kirov (2021) studied three different pet food formulations to meet nutritional requirements. Raw formulations were vacuum-sealed in plastic pouches and underwent HPP. Protein, fat, carbohydrate, fiber content and other biochemical indicators remained unchanged following HPP (Fig. 1), as did the energetic content. Figure 1. Biochemical indicators of unprocessed and HPP raw pet food formulations The authors reported no changes in the appearance, consistency or smell of raw HPP pet food. While there were some slight color changes, they had no adverse effect on health, and some research studies suggest there may be benefits for digestion. Clinical Studies: Blood Biochemical Indicators The researchers also looked at protein and cholesterol impact on raw HPP pet food. The daily intake of the raw HPP chicken diet improved protein metabolism, resulting in higher blood protein levels after 45 days. The raw HPP chicken diet also improved lipid metabolism, reducing cholesterol by 14%. The raw HPP chicken diet did not change essential minerals like calcium and phosphorous. The authors concluded, “Despite the short feeding period, we observed a positive effect of raw food on biochemical parameters.” They also stated, “Feeding dogs raw food for a period of 45 days gave positive results on protein and lipid metabolism.” Clinical Studies: Digestive Health The final part of this series of studies investigated the digestibility effects of a raw HPP chicken diet. Tend 10 healthy dogs were fed a dry pet food diet before the study, followed by a raw HPP chicken diet twice a day for 45 days. The study found the HPP diet improved digestion and reduced feces size. Overall, the studies found HPP pet food is one way to ensure a healthy, safe, nutritious food regimen for pets.

Miami (Aug. 19, 2022) – Hiperbaric, the world leader in supplying high pressure processing (HPP) equipment for the human and pet food industry, will showcase the latest innovations in raw pet food and high pressure processing (HPP) at SuperZoo Aug. 23-25 in Las Vegas. Hiperbaric will share the latest innovation in recycled pet food packaging, manufactured by Thanh Phu, a Vietnamese packaging company expanding its presence in the U.S. This fully recyclable packaging can undergo the HPP process for raw pet food. Hiperbaric will also share the latest innovations in freeze dry manufacturing, with Parker Freeze Dry of Winsted, Minn., whose equipment is used to freeze dry pet food and is compatible with the HPP process. Pet humanization is a growing trend. As demand for pet food products with greater nutritional value over traditional offerings increase, companies are looking at better ways to serve customers. “HPP shows great promise for raw pet food, as it inactivates fooborne bacteria, keeps nutrients intact, promotes health benefits and extends shelf life,” said Roberto Peregrina, director, Hiperbaric USA. As Hiperbaric expands its presence in HPP and raw pet food, it looks to collaborate with companies whose products or equipment can be used with high pressure processing, further promoting the benefits of HPP and raw pet food. Thanh Phu offers packaging that has been tested and successfully undergone the high-pressure Hiperbaric process. Testing was conducted at Hiperbaric’s U.S. facility in Miami. The high-pressure process works well for solid refrigerated meats that need to retain their shape and wet pet food in a pouch that does not need to retain a defined shape. Thanh Phu’s pet food packaging is third-party certified fully recyclable, according to Daryle McDonald, Thanh Phu’s Business Development director. They have received third-party validations from Europe and the U.S. “Our products contain Veloflex™ technology, a mono-material low-density polyethylene, which is the easiest material to recycle, as well as a high oxygen barrier, which benefits extended shelf life,” McDonald said. Hiperbaric will have the Thanh Phu pet food bags on display at its Booth #2352. Hiperbaric also will share information from Parker Freeze Dry. Typically, a processor will run its product through the HPP process prior to freeze drying.  HPP has shown significant success in the removal of pathogens from products. Freeze drying is the next step in keeping the product “clean” or shelf stable.  “When processed in the order described, the freeze drying process creates a shelf-stable product that is ready for packaging,” said Jerad Ducklow, executive vice president, Sales & Marketing.

Intesto-Guard,https://www.linkedin.com/company/intesto-guard%E2%84%A2,United States,"Newton,",IA,http://intesto-guard.com,Brands: ​Intesto–Guard™,"Intesto–Guard™ is a proven and patented probiotic, prebiotic and antibody formula which has produced very good results in the control of diarrheas caused by Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) and other chronic enteropathies. Vomiting and diarrhea are leading causes of veterinary visits each day, accounting for approximately 30% of hospital visits. Treatment methods are costly, relying on antibiotics and antibiotic resistance is on the increase. Intesto–Guard™ is a safe alternative to help all pets and horses. Newton, Iowa – December 2021 – Intesto-Guard™, the premier gastrointestinal (GI) pet supplement, is proud to announce its proven paste and powder formulas have received patent approval from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. This milestone marks a pivotal moment in the company's history, which first launched in 2017, as it seeks to fulfill its mission of providing complete gut health and improved quality of life for all pets. Intesto-Guard helps support the recovery of a wide range of stomach ailments and can be used to reduce diarrhea, coat/soothe the GI tract, support periodontal health, boost the immune system and promote a healthy gut. Some common gastrointestinal diseases that Intesto-Guard helps to resolve are inflammatory bowel disease and ulcerative colitis. Since 2017, Intesto-Guard has helped countless pets achieve healthier‚ happier and stronger lives with its powerful triple protection formula made up of prebiotics, probiotics and IgY antibodies (PPA). ""The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has just issued a novel, first-of-its-kind patent using a dietary supplement composition for the resolution of diarrhea in companion animals, pocket pets, birds and horses,"" said Dr. Valentino Grant, veterinarian/company director at Intesto-Guard. ""Intesto-Guard's dietary supplement comprising of a prebiotic yeast component, a probiotic component and an immune effector protein component (IgY antibodies) — together called PPA — is leading an exciting new wave of natural treatments for pet owners and veterinary practitioners."" Pet PPAs can be used both preemptively, prior to boarding or during a diet change, to help prevent the disruption of the normal bacterial composition in the intestines or after the onset of diarrhea to provide recovery support. Ultimately, Intesto-Guard believes all pets can benefit from a daily PPA supplement no matter the circumstances. Similar to humans, the gut is the largest immune organ in the body and contains approximately 70% of all immune cells. Thus, keeping a healthy balance of good and bad bacteria is vital for your pet's overall well-being as well as providing them with adequate protection against a variety of diseases. Supplementing your pet's diet with PPAs can make all the difference in the world between living with a chronically ill pet and a healthy pet. A PPA supplement, such as Intesto-Guard, is an easy step to add to your pet's daily routine and diet that can significantly improve their quality of life and keep them happy and active for years to come. Intesto-Guard cleans and protects the GI tract leading to improved nutrient absorption, more energy and better health overall. The vet-formulated product comes in two forms, powder and paste, and is made up of all-natural ingredients that taste great to pets. It is safe to use daily and can be conveniently sprinkled on top of food. However, PPAs alone cannot repair an unstable gut microbiome. Instead, they work best alongside a healthy, balanced diet rich in fibers and nutrients as well as regular exercise. All of this together promotes optimal wellness for your pet. Intesto-Guard's PPA formula has everything your pet needs to get well and stay well. Clinical trials are underway at Iowa State University's College of  Veterinary Medicine and The Ohio State University College of Veterinary Medicine to further evaluate the efficacy of Intesto-Guard, but the results and testimonials speak for themselves. Follow along on Facebook and Instagram and shop Intesto-Guard's products to provide the most comprehensive, natural protection against common diseases for your young and mature pets today! For more information, contact Intesto-Guard by phone/WhatsApp at 563-231-7999 or email info@intesto-guard.com. Your pet is a special family member deserving the best possible protection and care. Bowel infection is one of the most common causes of pet visits to the Vet. Pets are constantly licking their paws and many end up getting very sick or even dying from harmful organisms. Intesto–Guard™ helps to prevent illness and stimulates rapid recovery from Gastro Intestinal challenges. ORGANIC + NON-GMO + PPA PATENT"

They're made with insect protein! Insects are a sustainable, prebiotic superfood using exponentially less land, water, and feed than traditional protein.  Jiminy's nourish our pets & promotes a healthy planet. Jiminy’s new wet food entrees, Cravin’ Cricket and Good Grub, add another offering to our expanding line of insect protein dog foods and treats.  Designed as a topper or stand-alone meal, both entrees feature whole-food ingredients that you can see, including carrots, green beans, sweet potato, flaxseed, and pumpkin.  Jiminy’s pressure-cooks these ingredients, ensuring nutrition and bowl-cleaning great taste stay locked in.  Cricket protein and grub protein are also complete novel proteins with all the essential amino acids.  Even better, Cravin’ Cricket and Good Grub are humane, while offering relief for allergy and digestion issues.  Each entrée’s secret ingredient - sustainability – delivers large scale savings in land and water use along with substantial greenhouse gas reduction.  Additionally, the renewably sourced, lightweight, and recyclable Tetra Paks further narrow Jiminy’s environmental footprint.  More than ever, Jiminy’s means happy pets and a healthy planet. Say hello to Nooch and Peanut Puffs!  These treats are Jiminy’s newest offerings for SuperZoo 2022!  Our Nooch Puffs are an exciting new form of treat with a feel that dogs love – crunchy! – followed by a surprising melt in the mouth.  Your heart will melt as your pup enjoys the deliciousness of our Nooch Puffs while knowing you’ve served a humane treat that’s good for pup and planet.  What’s Nooch?  It’s a nickname for nutritional yeast – the vegan cheese alternative. These tasty puffs are powered by cricket protein, of course, so this is a fun treat with serious intentions.  Your dog gets the highest-quality protein, and the earth saves water, land, and greenhouse gases – it’s almost too perfect.  Our Peanut Puffs are a fantastic complement, with a rich peanut butter flavor subtly tinged with a sweet banana taste.  Finally, with both Peanut Puffs and Nooch Puffs, Jiminy’s happily reports our puffs contains 22% protein, are only 2 calories each and are, well, human-grade.  Fun for all!"

June 21, 2022, San Francisco, United States of America – NanoScent, a fragrance company based in the US and Croatia, launches a unique pet cologne & conditioner containing perfume nanocapsules that do not evaporate. The patent-pending formula enables the nanocapsules to only break when owners ""pet"" their dog or cat. After spraying the pet, when their coat is touched, the capsules break and disperse the fragrance in the air. This way, pets will smell fresher for much longer. Tests show that the pleasant scent lasts 13 times longer than any traditional spray. Through NanoScent’s process, the fragrance does not make contact directly with the pet's fur and skin (it's encapsulated inside the nanocapsules), ensuring the most pleasant experience for the pet because traditional fragrances might irritate them. NanoScent was also formulated to condition a pet's coat because too many products that make man’s best friend smell good will leave his skin dry. The product contains extra ingredients to nourish the skin and make the coat smooth and silky. The CBD line contains just the perfect amount of hemp seed oil, cold-pressed olive oil and glycerin and acts not only as a cologne but also as a moisturizer. NanoScent was designed and manufactured in Croatia by a team of scientists with decades of experience in the fragrance sector. Their formula is patent pending in the US and has already been patented in the EU. Visit www.nanotechscent.com to learn more about their products.

Say goodbye to customers juggling multiple products to the checkout line. Say hello to the future of multipacking in the pet industry. Increase sales and amp customer convenience. Stand out amongst the rest with the premium enhanced brand value of PetPak. Say goodbye to customers juggling multiple products to the checkout line. Say hello to the future of multipacking in the pet industry. Increase sales and amp customer convenience. Stand out amongst the rest with the premium enhanced brand value of PetPak. PakTech, a 31-year veteran in the sustainable packaging industry, announced its entry into the pet industry with the launch of its new subsidiary brand: PetPak. As more pet brands are realizing the benefits of multipacking, the future of pet product multipacking is set for exponential growth. Brands will need a way to stand out in the aisle and encourage consumers to pick up their product in bulk with ease. PetPak offers a sleek, sustainable option for pet industry brands using 100% recycled high-density polyethylene (HDPE) plastic to create recyclable packaging handles that let the product shine. “We are constantly looking for ways to innovate and deliver our sustainable solutions to broader industries, and the pet industry seemed like the perfect fit. Say goodbye to the struggle of juggling multiple pet products to the checkout line – PetPak delivers an easy way for brands to sell and for customers to carry multiple products with ease. PetPak brings years of successful industry expertise from parent company, PakTech. PakTech has a strong established portfolio and client base in the beverage, food and other CPG industries and is well recognized for its sustainability accolades. It’s our goal to carry our packaging proficiencies and sustainable advantages to the pet industry and create a future pet packaging trend with PetPak.” – says Director of Marketing, Elizabeth Kouns. With a minimal design that lets the product design take center stage, PetPak will provide an alternative multipacking solution that enhances brand value with a clean, premium look and feel to their products. Pet brands will also be able to choose from 31 unique color options and custom color, allowing them to find the perfect match to complement their brand. This simultaneously eliminates the need for unnecessary packaging that wraps around product detracting from the actual product design. Not only will products that use PetPak look premium, but their handles provide a customized fit for each product they are applied to, minimizing inventory loss – a common complication when using alternative secondary packaging options. This is a constructive step away from the commonly used shrink wrap, which is a single use material, obstructs a clear view of the product, and is prone to item slippage. Even worse, cardboard multipack options obscure the product entirely, easily fail when exposed to moisture and suffer significant environmental consequences adverse to what you might think. PetPak handles are made from 100% recycled HDPE, which is the same flexible, durable material used to make milk jugs, detergent bottles, and other household containers. HDPE is non-toxic, food safe, cost effective, and infinitely recyclable. This makes it a superior option for packaging, the planet, pet brands’ sustainability goals and budgets. “We believe that sustainable behavior is absolutely required to preserve and maintain our quality and diversity of life and the Earth’s ecosystems on which it depends,” says PetPak founder Jim Borg. Today, PetPak’s parent company serves major brands and emerging markets worldwide, thanks to their team of 300+ employees in Eugene, Oregon. PetPak is well-equipped and ready to deliver multipacking solutions to pet industry brands immediately and for years to come. Please visit www.PetPak.info to learn more."

AUSTIN, Texas -- RESET Bioscience, an advanced wellness company that uses pharmaceutical-grade ingredients and technologies, introduces Pet CBD Drops to their portfolio. Developed by leading Ph.D. scientists, RESET Pet CBD Drops are the world's first water-based, ingestible CBD for pets featuring Powered by Santé® Delivery Technology for rapid, maximum absorption and are double-tested to human standards.

RESET's highly bioavabile drops can be conveniently added to your pet's food, favorite treat, or even to it's water bowl with no separation since the formula is water-based. ""As a proud dog mom, my pets are an extension of my family and their health and wellness is of utmost importance,"" says Ashley Ferguson, President of RESET. ""I wanted to use  pet CBD treats to support my elderly Chihuahua's quality of life and calm down my anxious Doberman puppy at home. Before RESET's launch, I was testing treats and oils from big brands readily available in the market at a leading analytical laboratory. I was beyond shocked and disappointed to find alarming amounts of heavy metals including lead, mercury and even arsenic, residual solvents and microbiological contamination like E. coli and Salmonella in almost every product. The dosing suggestions from other companies also didn't make sense to me. I couldn't believe I was being recommended to dose my Chihuahua the same amount as my Doberman! We immediately felt compelled to put out a pet product using human-grade ingredients, protected with our best-in-class testing and saw the opportunity to apply RESET's delivery system, in partnership with Powered by Santé® Delivery Technology. The technology differentiates RESET Pet by offering faster, better absorption for more immediate results and safer dosing in line with a pet's weight. With this water based formula, pet parents can have peace of mind with each dosage whereas with oils, you risk liver toxicity because oil is not well processed through little livers. We are constantly focused on the next generation of wellness and are proud to extend that to animal health."" Cats and dogs, like humans, can take full advantage of the interaction between CBD and the endocannabinoid system. Because of this, CBD can have positive effects on everything from mood and supporting mind and body to overall wellness. RESET is thrilled to be able to provide e-commerce shoppers with award-winning CBD relief for their furry friends. RESET's newest advancement features premium traceable ingredients that are lab-tested to ensure potency, purity and consistency.

About RESET Pet CBD Drops: RESET Pet CBD drops can be added to your pet's water, food, or favorite treat but RESET suggests avoiding dropper contact with snoots.

Come & visit us for a chat! #6669 Easier for Your Customer| Better for Their Dog | Better for the Planet Founded in New Zealand in 2010, WashBar quickly grew to become the number 1 pioneering natural grooming brand in New Zealand.  The brand is produced in NZ sourcing many local NZ ingredients from curated suppliers, such as manuka and kanuka oils, beeswax and lavender, ultimately supporting small communities around the country. Our specialty manuka and kanuka oils draw on the benefits and growing consumer knowledge of New Zealand Manuka Honey.  Antibacterial and antimicrobial properties of the oils assist with solving everyday itching, and are gentle enough to be used on even sensitive skin.  Antimicrobial claims are backed by scientific research. 100% natural ingredients.  Paraben free. Alcohol free. Sulphate free. Vegan. Cruelty free. Tested on humans, not animals. Solid bars are easier to use to wash your dog than a liquid shampoo, allow for easy application across the entire body, and the lighter lather makes it easier to rinse, reducing the likelihood of soaps residue creating hotspots. Sustainability Merchandising Packaging Design and Aesthetic The WashBar packaging design reflects the company’s approach to the formulations.  Simple, pared back and honest.  No nasties, just the good stuff.  A pet parent picks up the vibe from the packaging, which is clean, natural and unfussy. The bar is curve shaped to make for easier use.  The underneath curve fits nicely against the curves of the animal’s skin and the upper curve allows the bar to fit easily in your hand to make for a more enjoyable washing experience for both dog and pet parent. Product Detail Original Soap for Dogs delivers a fantastic yet gentle everyday clean. Manuka WashBar is formulated with more Manuka and Kanuka oils to assist pets with skin that needs a little more help from their shampoo. Quality of Life WashBar facilitates the love between a pet and their human.  A clean dog with healthy skin and paws is much more likely to be out enjoying adventures in the great outdoors with their human. Some dogs love to lick so the WashBar ingredients are non-toxic and safe for dogs.  Even if your dog eats the soap, they are unlikely to suffer nothing more than an upset tummy and no lasting ill effects."

The Whitebridge brand portfolio includes Tiki Cat®, Tiki Dog™, Cloud Star®, Petite Cuisine®, Buddy Biscuits®, Dogswell®, Pet Botanics®,  Crazy Dog® and Grizzly®. ST LOUIS – July 12, 2022 – When Whitebridge Pet Brands merged with Italian-based Agras Pet Foods in April 2022, the US manufacturer took a major leap toward its goal of building a global natural pet health and nutrition company. Agras’s natural Schesir® brand dog and cat food was viewed as a perfect complement to Whitebridge’s treat, food and supplement brands, including Tiki Pets®, Cloud Star®, Dogswell®, Crazy Dog®, Pet Botanics® and Grizzly®.  Italian brands Stuzzy® and Adoc®, further amplified their position in the EU.  The combined entity, which continues to operate under the Whitebridge Pet Brands name, has a substantially enlarged international footprint, with four plants and sales in more than fifty countries. To signify the Whitebridge-Agras union, a striking new corporate logo has been designed, combining the best of the two companies’ well-recognized previous logos.  The new design features the name “Whitebridge Pet Brands” incorporated into the layout and colors of the former Agras logo, with its iconic square of blue, red, green and tan rosette-like shapes. “It’s really all about the pets, so an important consideration for me was the incorporation of both a dog and cat silhouette into the new logo,” said Matt Grant, Graphic Designer at Whitebridge. “Whitebridge’s philosophy has always been, ‘Better Together.’ The merger with Agras, which shares our mission of delivering natural and minimally processed pet food takes the synergies of working together to a whole new level.  New global capabilities for innovation, expanded distribution and growth, allow us to fulfill our promise of keeping pets happy and healthy, thereby doing the same for their people,” said Ann Hudson, Vice President of Marketing of Whitebridge Pet Brands. #       #       # About: Whitebridge Pet Brands was founded in January 2015 with the merger of Cloud Star, a leading pet treat manufacturer and Petropics, maker of Tiki Cat® and Tiki Dog® pet foods. In April 2017, Whitebridge Pet Brands acquired Dogswell®, a leading brand of functional jerkies for dogs. In January 2020, the company acquired Cardinal Pet Care, maker of Pet Botanics® and Crazy Dog® training treats. And in March 2021, Whitebridge Pet Brands completed the acquisition of Grizzly Pet Products, a leader in pet supplements. Whitebridge Pet Brand’s goal is to build a global natural pet health nutrition company that brings health and happiness to pets and owners with a range of minimally processed, natural, and wholesome dog and cat foods, treats, complements, and supplements. Whitebridge Pet Brands is headquartered in St. Louis, Missouri and has manufacturing operations in Joplin, Missouri, Woodinville, Washington and Copenhagen, Denmark. Agras Pet Foods was founded in 1986 in Genoa, Italy, with the mission to bring natural and high-quality products to the pet food sector and is today a leader in Europe in the distribution of natural foods for dogs and cats, with a particular focus on the wet manufacturing operations in Neive, Italy. ST. LOUIS, September 30th, 2021 -- Tiki Cat® has launched a new range of food products that will help kitties get started on the right paw. New Tiki Cat® Baby™ offers lifestage nutrition formulated to meet the complex dietary requirements of kittens ranging in age from newborn to 12 months. The line features 4 new formulas aligned with young felines’ developing nutritional and digestive needs, taking them from nursing to weaning to eating whole foods on their own.  The Tiki Cat Baby range complements the existing Tiki Cat mousse for kittens and includes: TIKI CAT® BABY™ THRIVE -- An innovative easy-to-lick liquid energy supplement for kittens ages newborn and up that are underweight or losing weight. Formulated so that even the youngest baby kitties can consume and digest it, Tiki Cat Baby Thrive is high in protein from real chicken, liver and easily digestible egg. It contains 28% fat and 25 calories in each tiny packet to promote healthy weight gain and increase energy among the littlest carnivores. TIKI CAT® BABY™ MOUSSE & SHREDS – For kittens 4 weeks and older, Baby Mousse & Shreds is formulated to help transition from mother’s milk. The perfect starter food for weaning kittens, its delicate layers of mousse and finely shredded poultry are easy on tiny teeth and gums, while easy-to-digest liver and egg is appealing to eat and is gentle on young tummies. Added prebiotics further aid digestion. The formula also includes supplemental taurine and balanced calcium and phosphorus to support healthy development during early growth, as well as DHA for brain development. Tiki Cat Baby Mousse & Shreds is available in a tasty Chicken, Salmon & Chicken Liver Recipe. TIKI CAT® BABY™ CHICKEN & SALMON RECIPE and TIKI CAT® BABY™ CHICKEN & EGG RECIPE These two formulas are whole foods recipes that provide complete nutrition for kittens from 8 weeks to 1 year. Ultra-high in protein and fat, these wet foods provide extra hydration to support growing carnivores. DHA promotes healthy brain development, and added taurine assures young felines get enough of this essential amino acid. “Kittens under 1 year make up 13% of the cat population (Packaged Facts), and these babies have very specialized nutritional needs,” said Ann Hudson, Vice President of Marketing for Tiki Pets®.  “To support their rapid growth, kittens need more energy from fat, protein building blocks, prebiotics and appropriately balanced ratios of calcium and phosphorous. “A kitten’s diet also must be more nutrient dense, because tiny stomachs can’t hold as much food,” added Hudson. “The Tiki Cat Baby range has been formulated to meet these requirements, while being made with delicious real proteins like chicken and salmon that will entice young kitties to eat.” Tiki Cat® Baby™ Thrive is available in Chicken & Chicken Liver Recipe, with an MSRP of $9.99 for a pouch of 20 .28-oz. servings. Tiki Cat® Baby™ Mousse & Shreds is available at $4.99 MSRP for a pack of 3 1.9-oz. cans. Tiki Cat® Baby™ Chicken & Salmon has an MSRP of $1.69 per 2.4-oz. can.

Not only have they been met with fantastic customer reviews, but following their debut at the 2022 Global Pet Expo in Orlando, Florida, they are in the process of becoming widely available at nationwide pet retailers. Woofkies dog treats are 100% handcrafted and hand-decorated cookies for dogs. Each treat is inspired by the memorable moments of a dog’s life, then decorated to perfection by the Woofkies team. The treats are made with 100% human-grade, nut-free, and vet-approved ingredients and enriched by a tasty Honey Peanut Butter flavor that dogs can’t get enough of. The Woofkies brand is dedicated to finding new ways for paw-rents and dogs to bond and share meaningful moments together. As a team of professional cookie decorators with over 20+ years of experience, Woofkies creates beautiful and one-of-a-kind artisanal treats that are smile-worthy for paw-rents and delicious for their dogs. The result is an experience unlike any other: Woofkies dog treats. Woofkies dog treats are making big first impressions. The treats were showcased for the first time in March at the Global Pet Expo—the largest pet industry trade show in the world—capturing the interest of everyone from local pet shop owners to international pet store retailers due to their uniquely memorable designs and precise decorations. Additionally, Amazon reviews for Woofkies dog treats are flooding in as 100% positive, pointing to the success of the Woofkies dream. “These dog treats are so cute--and my dog loved them!” wrote one 5-star reviewer, noting that the treats are “super fun and creative” and that “my dog wants them all!” ."

The earthmade by Boneve difference is characterised by: Quality – crafting in small quantities allows for more careful cooking and better production, resulting in a fresh, high-quality product. Clean ingredients – the quality of ingredients is a huge factor in feeding our pets. Pet food made in small batches uses carefully chosen, whole ingredients that meet your pet’s dietary requirements for optimal health. Fresh and natural pet food eliminates the need for harmful additives, lowering your pet’s chances of developing or triggering a food allergy. Better palatability – Small batch production often means that the products are always naturally harvested, so they taste better and are ideal even for the pickiest of eaters. Additive-free –  Our products are in their purest, most natural form because there are absolutely zero chemical additives or artificial extenders. These are unnecessary fillers since pet food aren’t supposed to sit on a shelf for years. Purity – Recalls and contamination in pet food are becoming increasingly common, making the quality of ingredients even more of a worry. Small batches are less likely to be contaminated because they contain ingredients from fewer sources."
