June 21, 2022, San Francisco, United States of America – NanoScent, a fragrance company based in the US and Croatia, launches a unique pet cologne & conditioner containing perfume nanocapsules that do not evaporate. The patent-pending formula enables the nanocapsules to only break when owners ""pet"" their dog or cat. After spraying the pet, when their coat is touched, the capsules break and disperse the fragrance in the air. This way, pets will smell fresher for much longer. Tests show that the pleasant scent lasts 13 times longer than any traditional spray. Through NanoScent’s process, the fragrance does not make contact directly with the pet's fur and skin (it's encapsulated inside the nanocapsules), ensuring the most pleasant experience for the pet because traditional fragrances might irritate them. NanoScent was also formulated to condition a pet's coat because too many products that make man’s best friend smell good will leave his skin dry. The product contains extra ingredients to nourish the skin and make the coat smooth and silky. The CBD line contains just the perfect amount of hemp seed oil, cold-pressed olive oil and glycerin and acts not only as a cologne but also as a moisturizer. NanoScent was designed and manufactured in Croatia by a team of scientists with decades of experience in the fragrance sector. Their formula is patent pending in the US and has already been patented in the EU. Visit www.nanotechscent.com to learn more about their products.

All Walks,United States,"Fort Benton,",MT,www.allwalkspet.com,-,"Hemptana hemp bedding is a premium bedding product for conscious owners and the animals they raise and care for. Hemp hurd is the most absorbent cellulose fiber and will absorb more than 4x it’s weight and will not crumble or disintegrate like wood, paper, pellets or other materials when saturated. This allows more spot cleaning without replacing the whole stall or cage and means less odor, easier to clean and overall less material needed. This makes it popular for travel, show and rodeo horses wanting to haul less and those that want to pamper their animals. Hemp bedding is a sustainable product made from plants grown for our Hemptana hempseed oil and protein products. The bedding is 100% compostable and once used can be added to backyard compost bins or gardens and around the farm. Low dust. Chemical Free. Hemp bedding is very comfortable for your horses, rabbits, chickens and more, creating a very pleasant environment. Hemptana products are grown on family farms and Made in Montana. Hemptana Equine Nutrition products are made in Montana from 100% hemp seed. Clean hemp seed grain is crushed in a cold press expeller, separating the healthy seed oil from the high protein and fiber containing seed meal. Hemptana Hemp Protein Super Snacks are made from 100% defatted hempseed meal in an easy to treat large pellet form. Contains 30% natural plant protein, 8% fat and up to 35% fiber and contains all 21 amino acids. 100% all natural and non-gmo health treats with no fillers, sugar or additives- the healthy way to treat your horse, donkey, goat, dog and more. Hemp Seed Oil is a 100% natural cold pressed seed oil containing the perfect ratio of Omegas 3, 6, and 9 fatty acids. Hemp seed oil contains the omega 6- gamma linolenic acid (GLA), which is not found in other vegetable oils. GLA promotes healthy anti-inflammatory properties and offers great overall immune support. Great for equine, dogs, and other livestock, pets and zoo animals. All Walks Hemp Bedding is one step on a far-reaching path to do right by the planet while creating products that are good for animals and smart for you. Available now in 2 retail sizes. All Walks Hemp Bedding is grown on family-owned American Farms and produced and packaged in rural Montana. Made of 100% natural hemp hurd fiber, our bedding is a new alternative to wood shavings and paper bedding products. Hemp bedding can absorb more than 4x it’s weight creating a cleaner cage environment, with less odors, that’s easier to clean. Hemp bedding is 100% compostable after use and can be used in backyard compost bins or in the garden. Industrial hemp is sustainable, growing to maturity in just 100 days and sequesters more carbon when growing and in use of the fiber than any other crop. Great for a wide range of small animals including rabbit, guinea pig, hamster, gerbil, ferret, finch, canary, parakeet, lovebird, poultry, snakes, chameleons, gecko’s, skinks, tarantula’s, scorpions and more.",-

This award signifies that Animal Essentials is in the top 20% of PSC Accredited companies for verified scores on our social focus areas, and their leadership toward bringing higher levels of sustainability and equal rights to the pet industry. Animal Essentials has also been certified as a Plastic Neutral company, through their partnership with RePurpose Global, a program by which the company now removes as much plastic from the environment as it produces by the manufacture of its products.  “This has been a big step toward addressing one of the largest consumer preference shifts in the past 10 years,” states CEO and Founder, Greg Tilford.  “Through our partnership, we are taking the first step toward systemic environmental change — financing waste management infrastructure and empowering marginalized workers fighting the plastic waste crisis on the frontlines.” Tilford continues, “As a company that has been specializing in herbal formulas for dogs and cats over the past 27 years, we used to think of the word sustainable only as sort of a synonym for the words certified organic.  I have since realized that the issues of sustainability reach far beyond farming methods… it also includes the people who are doing the farming, and the lands that they are using.  With a $261 billion global pet industry serving around 2 billion pets, the environmental, supply chain and social impacts of what we produce and later throw away is immense.  Our goal is to set an example of what can be accomplished by joining together and taking positive action toward assuring a bright, healthy future for our pets, our supply chain partners around the world, and most of all, our planet.” END CONTACT:  Greg Tilford, CEO.  Email:  greg@animalessentials.com  Phone: (888)551-0416 Company website:  https://www.animalessentials.com COME VISIT US AT SUPERZOO BOOTH #2181!",-

Freeze Dried Dog Snacks are high protein, minimally processed, sustainable treats and the first-of-their-kind in pet food, as they are made with a single, non-meat ingredient: Bmmune Nutritional Yeast. One ingredient. Totally sustainable. About 50% protein and all 10 amino acids dogs need. Noochies! are made from our very own nutritional yeast, Bmmune, a blend of immune-benefiting B vitamins, fiber and gut-pleasing fermented proteins. By culturing and then freeze drying our ingredients, we kept the nutrition bioavailable and easy to digest, and limited any nutrient loss that comes with overprocessing. And did we mention dogs love these savoury snacks? The snacks have a cheesy, umami flavor that dogs crave. The best part is they are cruelty- and slaughter-free. No factory farmed animals means none of the extreme envirnomental damage caused by factory farms – which is a leading cause of climate change. And they are packaged in post-consumer recylced bags.

ALLIANCE, Ohio – For customers that are looking for an effortless way to remove shedding hair from their pet's coat, our Safari® by Coastal line has several options. The newest addition is the Grooming Mitt and Glove. The left right design mitt can be used for wet or dry grooming and is specifically designed to trap loose hair. The glove, which is a nice option for petting, removes debris from the coat and promotes a stress-free grooming process. Pet grooming is important for the health and cleanliness of dogs and other pets. Grooming removes excess hair, which can prevent hairballs and skin irritation, and keep the pet smelling fresh. Grooming can also improve the quality of the coat and skin, increase blood circulation, and remove fleas. Dealing with pet shedding can be a challenge for any pet owner. Not only is it time-consuming to clean up, but it can also be frustrating when hair gets everywhere - on the clothes, in the workspace, and all over the furniture. Luckily, there are a few things one can do to help manage the shedding and make life a little easier. The Grooming Mitt and Glove are devised particularly to help with this problem. They quickly and efficiently remove shedding hair from both dogs and cats.

Soy protein is liquefied and then extruded into long, thin filament fibers that are then cut and processed similar to many other natural fibers. The protein is taken from the waste of food production, rather than harvesting the Soy beans especially for this purpose, meaning that nothing is waste. New Earth® Soy Adjustable Collar

• Perfect for dogs with sensitive skin New Earth® Soy Leash
• Soft, cashmere feel
• Anti-bacterial properties to control odor It gets better with age! While most collars wear out, get stinky or fall apart over time, leather collars actually get better with age. The leather takes in natural oils that enrich the color and causes the collars and leashes to become softer and more pliable over time. Leather leashes are a favorite with trainers, because they don't slip or cause the painful brush burns that can happen from using nylon or polyester training leads. A legacy reputation dog trainers trust The full grain, top quality leather is sourced from a company that's been specializing in leather for over 150 years. Hides are are drum dyed for consistent color saturation and the vegetable tanning method carefully processes the leather, creating a superior character in the final product. Moreover, vegetable tanning is a natural and eco-friendly process that uses a blend of tannins that includes the bark of Mimosa and Quebracho trees. The process is labor-intensive and can take up to six weeks to complete. Created for those woh love the outdoor lifestyle, Water & Woods is perfect for anyone with hunting and retriever dogs, as well as for camo enthusiasts. The new collars and leashes feature Mossy Oak out door & lifestyle patterns, matte gunmetal hardware, and a quick-release Alligator Snap on the leashes. Training dummies and foam trainers are designed to promote an easier grip.  Alongside the shape, their texture and construction provide a strong hold. When your dog's personality is too big for a plain, thin collar, the Sublime® Adjustable Dog Collar is the perfect choice. These wider-than-average collars feature two-sided complementary patterns for a unique look you'll love. And the durable plastic buckle holds up to the everyday wear a big dog puts it through.

Dogs can work for 30 min to over an hour to earn a normal meal. The entire game is controlled from a smartphone where people can change game settings and stream live video. The entire game is based on operant conditioning and positive reinforcement. At first, dogs are rewarded for learning the connection between the PupPod Rocker and feeder. Then the game gets harder, requiring dogs to touch the toy within 2-seconds of a reward sound. There are game levels to reinforce concentration, task discrimination and impulse control. PupPod is accessible to deaf, hearing impaired, and blind dogs. The mental stimulation can help reduce separation anxiety and lead to calm behavior.

DK Stainless are bringing Australia's favourite auto-refilling pet water bowl to the U.S. DK Stainless was founded in 2016 by Daniel (Dan) Karanges, a sheet metal fabricator by trade who represented Australia at  the 40th WorldSkills International Competition in Calgary, Canada, placing 3rd against the world’s leading sheet metal  fabricators. Dan was looking to find a water bowl solution for his Australian Kelpie, Boss, on those hot summer days while he was at  work. “After trying out several auto-filling water troughs from overseas manufacturers, I found that none were reliable  enough for Boss, who would accidently tip over or break these products” – Dan Karanges. Using his practical skills and  knowledge from his trade, this where the DK Stainless started. The DK Stainless Pet Rehydration Station is providing peace and mind not only to dog lovers but also zoos, wildlife  sanctuaries, police, and military working dogs here in Australia, the U.A.E and recently the U.S. Ben Dessen, Board Director and Sanctuary Manager and The Zambi Wildlife Sanctuary, Sydney loves utilising the Pet Rehydration Station as part of the  enclosures and rehabilitation facilities at the Sanctuary. “DK’s food and water stations are extremely high quality and have  been so useful for our kangaroos and emus.” – Ben Dessen.

Utilising their social media  presence and loyal following DK Stainless aim to shine the spotlight on Aussie manufacturing and the industry.

Tonisity Inc. Launches New Pet Hydration Products and More at SuperZoo Learn more at a special Media Happy Hour, on August 24 from 3 to 5 p.m. at Booth 7557 (Saint Joseph, Mo. July 22, 2022) — It’s the dog days of summer and with the country’s record heat waves, hydration has never been more important for cats and dogs. During this time of year dry pet food just isn’t enough. It often lacks the digestive enzymes that are found in raw foods, doesn’t have much variety, and often contains lots of grain that many pets can’t handle. But Tonisity Inc. is pleased to announce the additions of several new products in their highly successful DoggyRade, KittyRade, and YummyRade brand lines. The new hydration products will be unveiled August 23-25 at this year’s SuperZoo trade show at the Mandalay Bay Convention Center in Las Vegas. Attendees will have the first opportunity to check out Tonisity’s newest products, some of which will also be featured at the show’s New Product Showcase: All products are centered around prebiotics, which is essential to gut health and hydration. Prebiotics are the nourishment that promotes the growth of beneficial microorganisms in the intestines and feed the probiotics, which are foods or supplements that contain live microorganisms intended to maintain or improve the “good” bacteria in a pet’s gut. Hydration is critical to a pet’s health, as it regulates body temperature, lubricates joints, improves cognitive function, and cushions an animal’s brain and spinal cord. In studies done, DoggyRade dogs drink up to five times more water than pups that are offered only water. This special drink is highly palatable and ready to use on-the-go. Cats are notorious for not drinking enough water. If they don’t drink enough fluids, that can lead to potential health issues. In fact, one in three cats experiences some form of kidney disease, which often correlates to a lack of fluid intake. In company studies, KittyRade cats drank nine times more than regular water! YummyRade is a low-fat, low-calorie meal enhancer to improve the taste and palatability of pet food. It contains prebiotics to support good gut health. To learn more about these one-of-a-kind innovative products, members of the media are invited to attend a special Happy Hour to mix and mingle with the DoggyRade and KittyRade team, featuring complimentary wine and beer, which will be held at the company’s booth on Wednesday, August 24 from 3 to 5 p.m. PST.

Dogsee,India,"Bengaluru,",Karnataka,http://www.dogseechew.com,-,"Dogsee is a unique startup focused on creating healthy vegetarian dog treats. Founded in 2015, Dogsee’s aim is to challenge the status quo of chemically manufactured and preservative-infused dog treats and give way to more natural options. Its flagship product, the Dogsee Chew Hard Bars are long-lasting dental chews made from cow and yak cheese. These bars are custom made for dogs based on their size, age, and breed which not only add to a nutritious diet but also help fight plaque and tartar.  The product line also includes Dogsee Chew’s Puffed Treats made from cow and yak cheese and Dogsee Crunch - single-ingredient training treats made from real fruits or vegetables.

They're high in protein and low on carbs making them ideal for dogs, and lastly, the Himalayan connection brings rare minerals along with all organic alternatives to the processed treats. The cheese treats are a new concept in India. Dogsee was the pioneer in introducing Himalayan Cheese Treats to India. Dogsee is a unique startup focused on creating healthy vegetarian dog treats.

The cheese treats are a new concept in India. Dogsee was the pioneer in introducing Himalayan Cheese Treats to India. The dog treat brand has 4 facilities in Karnataka and has vowed to offer employment to 400 workers this year. One of the largest dog treats brands in the country, Dogsee, recently implemented Solar Energy in their facilities and became a carbon-negative  brand. The facility has achieved a net negative emission status and will continue to walk down the sustainable path with the help of a solar energy backing installed at the plant unit. The pivot towards sustainability comes in the light of the company's resolution to be the most ethical and ecological brand in the pet sector that not only caters to the well-being of pets but to the overall environment as well. The leadership at Dogsee aims to be a carbon-negative organization across all premises by the end of 2022. Sneh Sharma, Co-founder, of Dogsee states, “Our roots are intrinsically connected with nature and its forever generosity. It is only fitting that we do our bit for Mother Nature while ensuring that we offer the best of services and products. While expansion and  scalability have always been our aim, we intend to do this organically and more sustainably - hence our efforts to build net carbon factories that will run on solar energy. We are proud to establish one such unit and are working fervently towards making all our production and packaging units carbon-free by the end of the year”. The ecological ethos led the third factory has the production and processing capacity of the production of 100 tons Himalayan Chews every month, scaling it to 500 tons a month by the end of this fiscal year. The vision also includes new product lines comprising five Dogsee products this year in treats, cookies, and grooming range. The mission of increasing its product scalability is to build a one-stop platform for everything under pet care. In addition to being a completely sustainable unit by the end of the year, Dogsee also aims to enhance its workforce and hire 400 employees this year. With the increase in workforce and products, Dogsee envisions scaling its 1500 stores to 5000 stores in India, and 10k stores to 100k stores overseas by the end of the year. Dogsee, India’s fastest growing natural pet treat brand, has raised $7 Million in pre-series A round from Six Senses Ventures in November '21 and $5.6 Million in Series A funding round from Mankind Pharma in January '22. This marks Mankind Pharma’s entry into the pet food category. Founded by the husband-wife duo Bhupendra Khanal and Sneh Sharma, Dogsee is the only company to offer 100% vegetarian dog treats. The young company is taking on the rawhide treat industry, which they believe is extremely harmful to the dogs with all the added preservatives and chemicals. Dogsee treats, in comparison, are all-natural, human-grade, and protein-rich which have made them a huge success in the pet parents’ community globally. Dogsee is now India’s 5th largest pet food exporter and is loved by pet parents in more than 30 countries. Talking about the investment, Dogsee founder Bhupendra Khanal said, “Our products are the result of years of careful research focused on the precise nutritional needs of dogs. We put research and innovation at the heart of everything we do. The more we understand, the better placed we are to make a positive difference in the health and well-being of pets. Mankind Pharma has an established history of creating highly successful consumer products. Having the backing of such a giant is a huge vote of confidence for us and we look forward to learning from their expertise.” Sneh Sharma, Dogsee co-founder mentioned, “With Mankind, we share the common DNA of innovation. We are confident that with their support, we will be able to develop the niche that we have envisioned for the brand.” She also added, “Sixth Sense Ventures has been a great partner for us. We are excited to be deepening our partnership with this round. It speaks a lot about the trust and comfort we have established between us in such a short span of time.” The investment will primarily be used towards brand building, R&D, and building a strong distribution network. Speaking of their investment in Dogsee, Mr. Arjun Juneja Chief Operations Officer of Mankind Pharma said, “The trust that people have shown in Dogsee has strengthened our confidence to invest in a brand that is true to its nature. Mankind has always believed in innovation and, with brands like Dogsee that are innovative & young, we see the future of India.” Nikhil Vora, Founder & CEO of Sixth Sense Ventures added, “With their 100% Natural & Vegetarian offerings, Dogsee is uniquely positioned to make the most of the current global trends in the pet care industry. We are excited to deepen our partnership with Sneh and Bhupi and are elated to be part of their journey.” Dogsee has also been the winner of ETRise awards 2021 and was awarded the Brand of the Year in the Pet Meals and Treats category at the prestigious Channelier FMCG Awards 2021.",https://www.linkedin.com/company/dogsee-chew/

There is no better alternative to rawhide.","Durkha Chews are made using an ancient Himalayan recipe of Yak and/or Cow milk that is dried and hardened to form a delicious cheese snack for dogs. They are 100% natural, long-lasting, non-staining, odorless, and grain & gluten-free! There is no better alternative to rawhide. (PRESS RELEASE)Yak Cheese Chews were first introduced to the pet care industry in 2003. In 2022, Durkha Dog Chew in Kent, WA, and Kukuje GmbH in Hamburg, Germany, teamed up to reinvent the Cheese Chew. Dogs and dog parents love Yak Cheese Chews because they are long-lasting, grain, and gluten-free, and a healthy alternative to Rawhides. Whereas Rawhide cannot be broken down in a dog’s stomach and can swell and cause blockages, Cheese Chews are 100% natural and are only made with cheese and lime, and are easy for dogs to digest. When COVID shut down a majority of the world in 2020, Neil Pokharel, CEO at Durkha Dog Chew, connected with Narendra Shrestha, managing director at Kukuje GmbH in Germany. With Neil’s product development strategy and Narendra’s skills in cheese making stemming from being a third-generation member of a family that had the art and experience in the cheese making process, they set out to producing Yak Cheese Chews in Germany with the artisanal cheese craftmanship while using modern machinery. Two years later, Durkha and Kukuje partnered, and they now have the best quality Cheese Chews made with 100% pristine cow’s milk from Germany. These Cheese Chews are identical to Yak Cheese Chews from Nepal. Introduced to the U.S. market in 2021, Cheese Chews have been exactly what the pet industry market and consumers have been searching for in a quality Cheese Chew. “I had a vision of a healthy Cheese Chews for our fur babies across the globe and that vision was turned into a reality when I met Narendra,” says Neil Pokharel, CEO at Durkha. “With his high-level commitment towards quality and his precision towards creating a perfect product, we now can proudly share the news that we have the Cheese Chews for our customers that no one in the industry has.” Mud Bay, pioneers in natural pet care, has partnered with Neil and Durkha Dog Chew for many years. “We appreciate the ease of working with him in addition to the high quality of products they produce,” says the director of Mud Bay “Our trust in their transparency and quality of products is the reason we have partnered for many years on both Durkha branded treats in addition to partnering on private-label goods. We appreciate this partnership and look forward to its growth.” “With a high demand for quality Cheese Chews for companies and consumers in the US and around the globe, I had to use generations-old Cheese Chew making experience that was passed on to me from my family,” states Narendra Shrestha, Kukuje GmbH managing director “We are the only company outside of Nepal that has been successful in preserving the actual texture of the original Yak Cheese Chew from Nepal while still creating a healthy Cheese Chews that represents the Nepali art and the cheese-making traditions. This is something that has never been done before outside of Nepal.” Both the Traditional Cheese Chews and the Premium Quality Cheese Chews are offered for purchase. Whether you are looking to purchase the Traditional Cheese Chews directly from Nepal/US or our Premium Chews from Germany/US, stop by Booth #1881 at SuperZoo.

Founded by veterinarian Bob Goldstein and his wife, Susan, Earth Animal is pioneering a more humane and sustainable way of enhancing and preserving quality of life for animals, people, and the Earth. We source our catfish from the Chesapeake Bay where this non-native catfish species was introduced for recreational fishing in the 1960s. The species proved to have a higher tolerance to salinity leading to an overabundance. Today, catfish is considered an invasive species with many people, businesses, and organizations working together to manage the crisis. Fortunately for both humans and animals, blue catfish is both very tasty and nutritious. Using these fish in our diets is helping to clean up the waters and rebound native fish populations in the Chesapeake Bay – allowing a piece of the Earth’s natural ecosystem to heal. Also, sourcing catfish provides an opportunity for fishermen to earn an income from the invasive species that threaten their livelihoods. Non-native species outcompete native populations and disrupt the balanced food chain. No-Hide® is the original super-healthy, longer-lasting, and mind-blowingly tasty alternative to rawhide. By combining a healthy formula, high quality ingredients, and compassionate sourcing, No-Hide chews are offering dogs worldwide pure joy.

Cuneyt Emekci ,Managing Director of Emmi Ultrasonic comments “we thank our customers and retailers for acknowledging our high quality pet oral healthcare range in the united kingdom. It is a pleasure and honour for us to produce a product that provides health support to many animals worldwide and especially in the UK. When emmi-pet was developed about 10 years ago in cooperation with some veterinarians, we could not have foreseen the success of emmi-pet ultrasonic toothbrushes. This award is therefore also a great pleasure for us because we now have many customers in the UK and we receive so much positive feedback. Above all, the intense and increasing attention for oral hygiene shows us that the topic of animal health has become an integral and everyday part of animal care. We make our contribution to this every day and are proud of it. According to our guiding principle: Health begins in the mouth with brushing the teeth without scrubbing! Thank you for your trust and loyalty!   Tom Williams, BVSc, MANZCUS, MRCVS, president of the BVDA comments:” Toothbrushing is the best example of active homecare and goes a longway to keep gum disease at bay. With patient and gentle introduction and lots of praise and rewards, toothbrushing is achievable in most dogs & cats.To be most effective plaque needs removing daily and use a toothpaste which is specifically made for pets.Daily brushing will immediately enhance your pets oral healthcare environment and in the longrun will mean fewer problems for your loved ones and thus less visits to your veterinary practice.My advice is always to be mindful that Brushing should take priority over Dental treats as brushing removes plaque more effectively and thus prevents gum disease!!   Notes: BVDA ( British Veterinary Dental Association ) Dental technology is advancing at much the same pace as other areas of the healthare and pharmaceutical industry. Emmi Ultrasonic GmbH is a German firm specializing in the innovation, research, development, production, and distribution of ultrasonic and ultraviolet dental cleaning technology. To find out more about how this firm are leading the way in the dental industry, we profiled its innovative new offerings. Since the company´s inception under MD Cüneyt Emekci, Emmi Ultrasonic has been responsible for the development of some truly innovative new entries in the dental cleaning industry. These innovations are based on the team´s extensive experience in using ultrasonic cleaning equimpent in other areas such as hospitals, automotive engine cleaning for Ferrari and Ford, and aviation engine cleaning, for the likes of Air France and Lufthansa. As the ability for ultrasonic and ultraviolet technology to clean these industrial areas more than adequately demonstrates its capability, Emmi Ultrasonic has continued to prove its applicability to the dental industry. The firm´s product range includes ultrasonic cleaning equipment for ensuring total sanitation, even for the smallest and hardest-to-reach places. As part of the firm´s global reach, the two departments focused on dental cleaning are emmi®-dent, and emmi®-pet which offer a range of dental cleaning products, including toothbrushes, toothpastes, moutwash, and loss. emmi®-dent is focused on the human population of German for now, whilst emmi®-pet seeks to address the need for a safe and comfortable solution for cleaning pets teeth. With approximately ten million dogs in Germany and eighty million dogs in total across Europa, there is a huge market for the products that emmi®-pet is offering. Developed using the most sophisticated technology, the ultrasonic toothbrush from emmi®-dent far supersedes traditional methods of toothbrushing. Whilst a manual or electric toothbrush might reach many areas of the mouth, there are still hard-to-reach aresas that can remain unclean. However, the ultrasonic technology of emmi®-dent´s offering is not only virtuallly contactless, but it works at a speed of up to 96 million microvibrations per minute to ensure that even those hart-to-reach areas are cleaned professionally, thoroughly, and gently. Whilst using the ultraonic toothbrush developed emmi®-dent, ultrasonic waves penetrate even the smallest of gaps in the mouth, including braces, crowns, and implants. Not only does the product offer an effective method of keeping theeth clean; scientific studies have also shown it to be an efficient guard against build ups of tooth plaque, periodontitis, and gum disease. For pet owners, brushing their beloved companion´s teeth can prove to be a difficult task for a number of reasons. Whether it be their sensitivity to sound, mout odour, or lack of ability to sit still, brushing a pet´s teeth can be tricky. However, emmi®-pet seeks to address this with a similar range of ultrasonic products that are engineered specifically for cats and dogs. Firstly, emmi®-pet works soundlessly and motionslessly to ensure any cherished pet remains totally calm throughout. Wheter cat or dog, tartar is an issue often found in the offices of most veterinarians. emmi®-pet can not only help to remove the tartar, but also the large amounts of bacteria that can ultimately lead to gingivitis and tooth loss. Uncompromising in ist pursuit of excellent oral health across Germany and the entirety of Europe, Emmi Ultrasonic has developed a game-changing addition to the market. With little-to-no contact, millions of vibrations per minute, and cleaner mouth for both humans and animals alike, there is nothing to stop both he emmi®-dent and emmi®-pet revolutionizing the way oral health is approached for years to come. https://www.ghp-news.com/issues/technology-awards-2019/22/ Emmi Ultrasonic GmbH, a German based company that specializes in the development, manufacturing and worldwide distribution of oral and skin care products based on ultrasonic technologies is pleased to announce that its core pet brand: “ The emmi-pet 2.0 Ultrasonic toothbrush “is now available in the north American market for pet groomers and their customers.

It is very important to replace the ultrasonic attachments of emmi®-pet after 3 months of use. After this time, the ability of the attachment bristles to effectively transmit ultrasonic waves will diminish and therefore optimum dental cleaning and oral hygiene can no longer be guaranteed. The specially customized attachment for the thorough and gentle tooth care for cats and dogs is available in two sizes: the small attachment is suitable for cleaning incisors and little back teeth. Cleaning the teeth one or two times a week with ultrasonic is completely sufficient for a strong and healthy set of teeth. Good dental hygiene is also important for dogs. Because even dogs have dental problems such as plaque, tartar or gingivitis. To keep the teeth of your four-legged friend healthy, you need to help him with the dental care. The ultrasonic atttachment of emmi®-pet was specially developed for the thorough and gentle dental care of dogs. It cleans with ultrasonic where normal bristles are difficult to reach.

Please use the emmi®-pet ultrasonic attachment (large) to clean canine teeth and bigger back teeth.

Healthy teeth provide a strong dentition and prevent further diseases.

It is very important to replace the ultrasonic attachments of emmi®-pet after 3 months of use. After this time, the ability of the attachment bristles to effectively transmit ultrasonic waves will diminish and therefore optimum dental cleaning and oral hygiene can no longer be guaranteed. As part of the emmi®-pet dental cleaning and oral hygiene with 100% original ultrasound is provided by the special ultrasonic toothpaste from emmi®-pet by the formation of microbubbles, which have been enriched in an additional production step, for an optimal cleaning effect. The original emmi®-pet ultrasonic and the emmi®-pet ultrasonic toothpaste form millions of microbubbles in the mouth in every fraction of a second. The microbubbles penetrate into the interdental spaces as well as into the smallest gaps and implode (harmless for the animal) due to the multi-frequency oscillations of emmi®-pet ultrasonic toothbrush. They remove biofilms and impurities and reduce germs and bacteria. By using the original emmi®-pet ultrasound eliminates the abrasive brushing of the teeth. For this reason the emmi®-pet Ultrasonic toothpaste so gentle to the enamel and gums of your pet. The teeth retain their natural protection against bacteria and germs and the risk of gum and tooth disease can be significantly reduced. The procedure is completely safe and even helps to prevent bad mouth odor.",-

Press Release: In a world of fast pace technology, Healers PetCare has built a smart bottle to help pet lovers care for their animals on a daily basis. Vancouver, WA – Healers PetCare is excited to make another appearance at SuperZoo this August since their first time attending in 2012. Lots of excitement from returning customers as Healers launches their newest creation, Healers Smart Bottle, found in the new product showcase. This remarkable technology is a stainless steel, reusable bottle with a programmable smart cap. Along with the bottle comes a free, easy to download app that will aid in daily reminders, dosage amount and refill requests. Once set up, the cap will emit a light followed by a sound, as well as a friendly text and email so that doses are never forgotten. “We know your pets are a part of the family, so here at Healers we strive to build products that make caring for them easy. With this smart bottle you can use this for daily medications, supplements or even treats” says Sarah King, Marketing Specialist at Healers PetCare.

Plus being environmentally friendly” Healers PetCare has a mission to be a one-stop-shop for all pet health needs. It all started with the Medical Boot. Founded in 2011, Terri decided to take matters into her own hands when her German Shepherd Jake, injured his paw on a mountain hike.  After hearing the Veterinarians orders for at-home treatment, she decided to make her own boots using a breathable fabric she found and a sewing machine. Realizing her boots cut the healing time in half, Terri wanted to bring her ideas to the market, and the rest is history. As Healers PetCare announces new creations, they also have seen significant growth in the pet health industry. Healers Line of Urban Walkers Dog Boots is now available at any local Target™ and many of their pet health products will be added to other major retailers by year end. “We will share more on this soon!

Pet food applications include fresh, raw, frozen, and freeze-dried foods. Hiperbaric is the global leader and manufacturer of High Pressure Processing (HPP) technology. This non-thermal preservation method uses cold water and high pressure to offer food safety, freshness, extended shelf life, and new market opportunities. Pet food applications include fresh, raw, frozen, and freeze-dried foods. Miami (June 29, 2022) – Hiperbaric, the world leader in supplying high pressure processing (HPP) equipment for the human and pet food industry, will exhibit at SuperZoo Aug. 23-25 in Las Vegas. Hiperbaric will exhibit at Both #2352. HPP is a nonthermal process that applies water and high pressure to products in their final packaging to eliminate foodborne bacteria, promote clean labels, maintain nutrition and taste, and extend shelf life. Among its many applications is raw pet food to achieve the Food & Drug Administration’s required 5-log reduction in raw pet food, as well as promote fresher ingredients and extend shelf life. HPP has been widely reported to retain the nutritional and sensory properties of raw pet food formulations. It has become increasingly popular as a method of pathogen control since the Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) was introduced in 2011. Hiperbaric is considered a resource on HPP and pet food, publishing several documents on the subject including white papers, flyers and case studies. Companies like Nature’s Variety, Steve’s Real Food and Kiwi Kitchens, among others, use HPP in their pet food processing. HPP benefits include food safety, cross-contamination prevention, fresh ingredients, clean label, health attributes and a variety of formats and packaging. HPP allows the commercialization of fresh, frozen, and freeze-dried foods in the form of minced mixtures, chubs, kibbles, and raw meaty bones.

Contact: Wendy Alpine Alpine Communications wendy@alpinepr.com 404-641-6170 Miami (August 11, 2022) – Leaders in high pressure processing (HPP) discussed the latest trends, including raw pet food and HPP, at Hiperbaric’s Innovation Week, June 21-23. More than 1,000 attendees participated in the event virtually. All sessions are on demand. Hiperbaric is the world leader in supplying high pressure processing (HPP) equipment for the human and pet food industry. HPP is a nonthermal process that applies water and high pressure to products in their final packaging to eliminate foodborne bacteria, promote clean labels, maintain nutrition and taste, and extend shelf life. Among its many applications is raw pet food to achieve the Food & Drug Administration’s required 5-log reduction in raw pet food, as well as promote fresher ingredients and extend shelf life. HPP has been widely reported to retain the nutritional and sensory properties of raw pet food formulations. It has become increasingly popular as a method of pathogen control since the Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) was introduced in 2011. Among the topics of HPP Innovation Week was “Facts and Myths Using HPP for Fresh and Raw Pet Food,” presented by Vinicio Serment, U.S. Applications and Food Processing Specialist, Hiperbaric. Vinicio discussed the benefits of HPP for raw pet food including weight management, improved digestion, increased energy, vibrant skin and coat and improved oral health. More companies are turning to HPP for raw pet food processing to ensure safety for pet owners and their pets, he said. Serment explained that HPP has minimal impact on sensory and bioactive compounds and minimizes risks associated with common foodborne pathogens. Pet food companies like Steve’s Real Food have performed their own studies to assess the impact of HPP on the nutritional components of raw formulations, concluding that HPP is safe and effective. Further research is available in “Q&A with HPP raw pet food manufacturers”. In addition to safety and nutrition, HPP allows the commercialization of fresh, frozen, and freeze-dried foods in the form of minced mixtures, chubs, kibbles, and raw meaty bones. With the extended shelf life, HPP allows producers to expand sales into geographic regions that they previously couldn’t serve, due to limited shelf life.

MIAMI (August 11, 2022) – When consumers purchase raw pet food for their furry friends, they want to make sure the product contains natural ingredients, with no additives or preservatives. That’s why Steve’s Real Food uses high pressure processing (HPP) in the manufacture of its raw pet food. HPP is a non-thermal food preservation process that uses cold water and high pressure to inactivate foodborne pathogens. In addition, it keeps the food’s organoleptic and nutritional properties intact, without preservatives, and extends shelf life. Steve’s Real Food has been a pioneer of the raw pet food diet as the first commercial raw brand on the market in 1998. Its products are produced with locally sourced, free-range meat and poultry without antibiotics or hormones. In 2011, Steve’s Real Food was searching for a solution to comply with stricter food safety regulations while using only natural ingredients without preservatives. The company used a test and hold process for foodborne pathogens, but it proved insufficient. It also needed to prevent cross-contamination in the production of meat and poultry. “We tested acid sprays, biophages, test and hold, probiotic sprays, and environmental controls,” said Nicole Lindsley, Owner, Steve’s Real Food. “None of them could produce our goal of a 5-log reduction.” Steve’s then turned to Hiperbaric, the world’s leading manufacturer of HPP equipment. With the help of HPP, Steve’s Real Food keeps their pet food safe while using only natural ingredients without preservatives. The $11 million business is growing, thanks to HPP’s shelf-life extension that has enabled them to sell their products to independent retailers nationwide, and open new markets in South Korea and China. Today, Lindsley is an HPP advocate, conducting consumer awareness efforts to educate pet owners, veterinarians and retailers about the benefits of HPP. Additionally, Steve’s has participated in Hiperbaric webinars, as well as presentations at industry conferences, with Dr. Vinicio Serment-Moreno, Applications & Food Processing Specialist.

Miami (August 17, 2022) - Hiperbaric, the world leader in supplying high pressure processing (HPP) equipment for the human and pet food industry, recently shared insights into the risks and safety of raw pet food diets. Raw pet food poses a health risk for pets and humans as it can be contaminated with pathogenic bacteria. High pressure processing, or HPP, is an excellent method to inactivate these food-borne pathogens while maintaining the nutritional integrity of the food. HPP is a nonthermal process applying water and high pressure to products in their final packaging to eliminate foodborne bacteria, promote clean labels, maintain nutrition and taste, and extend shelf life. Many myths surround HPP pet food, including nutrient degradation, enzyme inactivation, or inefficient pathogen control. Hiperbaric explains the facts. Is there a risk of raw pet food being unsafe for pets and pet owners? Pet diets based in raw meat products present several benefits, such as improved nutrition, healthier/regular digestion, cleaner teeth, shinier coat and relief from food allergies/sensitivities. However, raw pet food poses a health risk for both animals and humans since it can be contaminated with food-borne pathogens. Although pets can be more tolerant to some bacteria, they are not completely immune. In addition, food-borne pathogen transmission from pet to owner is possible through the pet’s mouth, fur, skin, or any body part that comes in contact with contaminated saliva or feces. Additionally, the owner may inadvertently spread pathogens through kitchen surfaces or appliances by handling the raw pet food, risking cross-contamination if not properly sanitized. Methods such as HPP will eliminate this risk by inactivating bacteria. What is the effect of HPP on pet food? The “Steve’s Real Food’s Study of High-Pressure Processing on Raw Meat Diets” reports the effects of HPP on 95 vitamins, proteins, essential amino acids, fats, and fiber. The results showed that HPP did not alter the concentration of the analyzed components, as the change percentage remained between –1% and 1%. Only 4 out of the 95 tested components presented a slight decrease following HPP. What is the shelf-life of HPP pet food? Is it compatible with other pet food interventions like freezing, freeze-drying and fermentation? In addition to food safety, HPP allows shelf-life extension by slowing the growth of spoilage microorganisms like yeasts and molds. This achieves between 14-35 days of shelf-life in refrigerated storage, compared to 7-10 days of unprocessed products. Bacteria and other microorganisms adapt to different unfavorable environments and might survive freezing, freeze-drying, or fermentation. Applying HPP acts as a “kill step” for food-borne pathogens. Cold storage (refrigeration, freezing) or freeze-drying further minimizes the risk and extends shelf-life. For example, the combination of HPP and freezing yields up to 2 years of shelf life. Freeze-drying also achieves up to 2 years of shelf life and allows ambient temperature storage. Does HPP eliminate all fooborne bacteria? HPP does not eliminate bacterial spores. What about probiotic bacteria? Various species of lactic acid bacteria considered as probiotics are resistant to high pressure. Does HPP change the color of meat? HPP induces a “cooked-like” appearance in uncooked pet foods, while most of the nutrients remain unchanged. The color change is related to slight structural changes, but the nutritional value of the protein and its amino acid sequence remain intact. The inclusion of natural ingredients such as beets or grape pomace improves the red color of HPP meat. Which pet food companies are using HPP? HPP pet food has earned the trust and acceptance of pet owners and pets, making pet food companies more confident in switching to HPP. Companies that use HPP include Balanced Blends, Instinct, Kiwi Kitchens, Petkis, Primal Pet Foods, and Steve’s Real Food, among others. Hiperbaric will exhibit at Super Zoo Aug. 23-25 in Las Vegas. Visit them at booth #2352. About Hiperbaric Hiperbaric is the world’s leading supplier of high pressure processing (HPP) equipment for the food industry.

Miami (August 17, 2022) – High Pressure Processing (HPP) has been widely reported to retain the nutritional and sensory impact of raw pet food. HPP, a food preservation method, minimizes risks associated with common foodborne pathogens. Hiperbaric, the world leader in supplying high pressure processing (HPP) equipment for the human and pet food industry, works with pet food processors and other agencies to assess the impact of HPP on raw pet food. In addition to safety and nutrition, HPP enables pet food to be commercialized as fresh, frozen, and freeze-dried foods in minced mixtures, chubs, kibbles, raw meaty bones, and many more forms. Clinical Studies of HPP Raw Pet Food Formulation Clinical studies have shown that HPP is safe for pets. Bulgarian researchers Neshovksa, Shindarksa and Kirov (2021) studied three different pet food formulations to meet nutritional requirements. Raw formulations were vacuum-sealed in plastic pouches and underwent HPP. Protein, fat, carbohydrate, fiber content and other biochemical indicators remained unchanged following HPP (Fig. 1), as did the energetic content. Figure 1. Biochemical indicators of unprocessed and HPP raw pet food formulations The authors reported no changes in the appearance, consistency or smell of raw HPP pet food. While there were some slight color changes, they had no adverse effect on health, and some research studies suggest there may be benefits for digestion. Clinical Studies: Blood Biochemical Indicators The researchers also looked at protein and cholesterol impact on raw HPP pet food. The daily intake of the raw HPP chicken diet improved protein metabolism, resulting in higher blood protein levels after 45 days. The raw HPP chicken diet also improved lipid metabolism, reducing cholesterol by 14%. The raw HPP chicken diet did not change essential minerals like calcium and phosphorous. The authors concluded, “Despite the short feeding period, we observed a positive effect of raw food on biochemical parameters.” They also stated, “Feeding dogs raw food for a period of 45 days gave positive results on protein and lipid metabolism.” Clinical Studies: Digestive Health The final part of this series of studies investigated the digestibility effects of a raw HPP chicken diet. Tend 10 healthy dogs were fed a dry pet food diet before the study, followed by a raw HPP chicken diet twice a day for 45 days. The study found the HPP diet improved digestion and reduced feces size. Overall, the studies found HPP pet food is one way to ensure a healthy, safe, nutritious food regimen for pets.

Miami (Aug. 19, 2022) – Hiperbaric, the world leader in supplying high pressure processing (HPP) equipment for the human and pet food industry, will showcase the latest innovations in raw pet food and high pressure processing (HPP) at SuperZoo Aug. 23-25 in Las Vegas. Hiperbaric will share the latest innovation in recycled pet food packaging, manufactured by Thanh Phu, a Vietnamese packaging company expanding its presence in the U.S. This fully recyclable packaging can undergo the HPP process for raw pet food. Hiperbaric will also share the latest innovations in freeze dry manufacturing, with Parker Freeze Dry of Winsted, Minn., whose equipment is used to freeze dry pet food and is compatible with the HPP process. Pet humanization is a growing trend. As demand for pet food products with greater nutritional value over traditional offerings increase, companies are looking at better ways to serve customers. “HPP shows great promise for raw pet food, as it inactivates fooborne bacteria, keeps nutrients intact, promotes health benefits and extends shelf life,” said Roberto Peregrina, director, Hiperbaric USA. As Hiperbaric expands its presence in HPP and raw pet food, it looks to collaborate with companies whose products or equipment can be used with high pressure processing, further promoting the benefits of HPP and raw pet food. Thanh Phu offers packaging that has been tested and successfully undergone the high-pressure Hiperbaric process. Testing was conducted at Hiperbaric’s U.S. facility in Miami. The high-pressure process works well for solid refrigerated meats that need to retain their shape and wet pet food in a pouch that does not need to retain a defined shape. Thanh Phu’s pet food packaging is third-party certified fully recyclable, according to Daryle McDonald, Thanh Phu’s Business Development director. They have received third-party validations from Europe and the U.S. “Our products contain Veloflex™ technology, a mono-material low-density polyethylene, which is the easiest material to recycle, as well as a high oxygen barrier, which benefits extended shelf life,” McDonald said. Hiperbaric will have the Thanh Phu pet food bags on display at its Booth #2352. Hiperbaric also will share information from Parker Freeze Dry. Typically, a processor will run its product through the HPP process prior to freeze drying.  HPP has shown significant success in the removal of pathogens from products. Freeze drying is the next step in keeping the product “clean” or shelf stable.  “When processed in the order described, the freeze drying process creates a shelf-stable product that is ready for packaging,” said Jerad Ducklow, executive vice president, Sales & Marketing. HPP is a nonthermal process that applies water and high pressure to products in their final packaging to eliminate foodborne bacteria, promote clean labels, maintain nutrition and taste, and extend shelf life.

Home Range / Open Range,Canada,"Calgary,",AB,https://openrangepettreats.com/,-,"BULLY STICKS AND MORE! New healthy and natural alternatives to the ever-popular Bully Stick are here! Pizzle Bully Sticks remain an incredibly popular dog treat and are the number one selling body part in the natural treat category. Historically positioned at the front of the store, body parts (pizzle bully sticks, esophagus, cow’s ears, bones, trachea, tendons, etc.) are great margin drivers usually sold at full price. Often your customers add them to their monthly purchase of dog food. Healthy margins, high turns, long shelf lives, and most importantly, a dog’s favorite, bully sticks and other body parts are a winning part of a retailer’s assortment. How did Bully Sticks become so popular? In part, customers were looking for a healthy alternative to Rawhide treats. Every good story has a villain, and in the natural treat category of body parts, that villain is Rawhide. Many respected dog associations and veterinarians have warned against the use of rawhide as a treat for dogs. From chemicals used to keep the outer hide soft during transport to the tannery to low digestibility and potential gastrointestinal issues, customers were looking for an alternative chew to rawhide. Natural body parts, especially Pizzle Bully Sticks, became the healthy and preferred option for a dog chew. What are Bully Sticks, and how are they made? Beef Pizzle Bully Sticks are 100% pure beef and a long-lasting natural chew. And as most of you know, just like all our natural treats, they are made from a body part. Yes – in this case, the penile tract of a bull. Hung with a weight on a drying rack to keep it straight, the pizzle is slowly and thoroughly dehydrated over 2-3 days. With no moisture remaining, bully sticks have very long shelf lives–you’ll sell them long before they ever expire!  Being truly natural treats, our products will vary in size, color and appearance. That variation is the hallmark of authentic natural treats. They are also nutritious and a high-quality source of protein that supports muscle development and overall health, while 100% digestible to ensure absorption of the proteins and minerals that support a healthy immune system. Additionally, they help remove tartar and plaque while the dog chews, promoting healthy teeth and gums. And they are a source of Omega Fatty Acids that promote healthy skin and coat. Is there an alternative to the bully stick on the horizon with the price rising? Beef is a commodity, and the price of beef rises with rising demand for beef in the human food chain, combined with increased production costs. That commodity price increase from the human food chain is also applied to our raw materials. The price of many consumer items has been rising this past year, and beef is no exception. Although Pizzle Bully Sticks are still the top-selling natural body part treats, the “next” bully stick will give some price relief to your customers. The new Cheeky Bully Stick is made from 100% pure beef cheek meat. It looks like a Pizzle Bully Stick, and dogs love its great beefy taste! It chews like a Pizzle  Bully Stick; it is 100% digestible and retails for up to 25% less than our most popular odor reduced Pizzle Bully Stick! Great retail price, significant retail margins. And from a supply perspective, while we have only one pizzle on a bull, we have two cheeks on both the female and male bovine. This ensures we have great fill rates on cheek sticks just like we do on our famous Bully Sticks. Are Cheeky Bully Sticks nutritious? Cheek meat is a high protein (82%), low fat (3%), and easily digestible dog treat. A medium to hard chewing treat, it helps to reduce plaque and tartar, with the beefy flavour dogs love. It is naturally rich in collagen, which contributes to healthier joint function. Cheeky Bully Sticks are a slightly longer-lasting chew than a Pizzle Bully Stick, providing outstanding value for the customer and, most importantly, for the dog’s enjoyment.

DUZ V2 dryer is available Amazon, Petco, Chewy and the is receiving US and Japan customers' positive reviews. In addition, we have a plan to launch a new product within this year (Product name: DUZ V3 dryer). It was launched at Kickstarter that is the most leading crowdfunding platform and hit its target funding goal for the DUZ V3 dryer. iM Co., Ltd. will participate in the ""2022 Superzoo exhibition."" which will occur at the Mandalay Bay Convention Center in Las Vegas, the USA, from August 23 to August 25. When owners bathe their pets, the most challenging thing is ""drying fur."" In response, iM developed a ""Duz Hands-Free Dryer"" that can dry the dog's fur without using hands. ""Duz,"" displayed at the ""2022 Superzoo exhibition,"" is a hands-free dryer that can fix the blower at the desired height and direction using a flexible hose that rotates 360 degrees. As both hands are free, it is effective in shortening the bath time as you can hold and brush your dog at the same time. The ""Duz"" can change the wind in 3 and temperature in 4 stages, does not generate dust during use, and has little noise, reducing stress for dogs with sensitive hearing. It is also semi-permanent because it is equipped with a BLDC motor. The temperature remains constant even when the wind strength changes, so it is safe and has low electricity consumption. ""Duz Hands-Free Dryer"" is a new concept dryer product that can be used in various places such as pet fur as well as shoes, sneakers, socks, and shirts,  which induces a change in the paradigm of how to use the dryer. Sung Yeol-gyu, CEO of iM, said, ""Duz has been sold in Japan, the U.S, and many other countries with high praise for its thorough quality control. We plan to enter Europe after obtaining certification from each country."" Meanwhile, this year's Superzoo will feature a lineup of show highlights and new features, including an energetic show floor with five product specialty areas, dedicated spaces for new products and emerging brands, a robust education program, and world-class grooming contests, and an exclusive beach party networking event. Duz dryer is a hands-free product that can comb pets while drying comfortably and conveniently. Therefore, our customers use it for drying their pets after bath. Also, the range of Duz usage is extensive, such as drying laundry, shoes, or socks by taking advantage of hands-free and fixed mounting features.

Intesto-Guard,United States,"Newton,",IA,http://intesto-guard.com,Brands: ​Intesto–Guard™,"Intesto–Guard™ is a proven and patented probiotic, prebiotic and antibody formula which has produced very good results in the control of diarrheas caused by Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) and other chronic enteropathies. Vomiting and diarrhea are leading causes of veterinary visits each day, accounting for approximately 30% of hospital visits. Treatment methods are costly, relying on antibiotics and antibiotic resistance is on the increase. Intesto–Guard™ is a safe alternative to help all pets and horses. Newton, Iowa – December 2021 – Intesto-Guard™, the premier gastrointestinal (GI) pet supplement, is proud to announce its proven paste and powder formulas have received patent approval from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. This milestone marks a pivotal moment in the company's history, which first launched in 2017, as it seeks to fulfill its mission of providing complete gut health and improved quality of life for all pets. Intesto-Guard helps support the recovery of a wide range of stomach ailments and can be used to reduce diarrhea, coat/soothe the GI tract, support periodontal health, boost the immune system and promote a healthy gut. Some common gastrointestinal diseases that Intesto-Guard helps to resolve are inflammatory bowel disease and ulcerative colitis. Since 2017, Intesto-Guard has helped countless pets achieve healthier‚ happier and stronger lives with its powerful triple protection formula made up of prebiotics, probiotics and IgY antibodies (PPA). ""The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has just issued a novel, first-of-its-kind patent using a dietary supplement composition for the resolution of diarrhea in companion animals, pocket pets, birds and horses,"" said Dr. Valentino Grant, veterinarian/company director at Intesto-Guard. ""Intesto-Guard's dietary supplement comprising of a prebiotic yeast component, a probiotic component and an immune effector protein component (IgY antibodies) — together called PPA — is leading an exciting new wave of natural treatments for pet owners and veterinary practitioners."" Pet PPAs can be used both preemptively, prior to boarding or during a diet change, to help prevent the disruption of the normal bacterial composition in the intestines or after the onset of diarrhea to provide recovery support. Ultimately, Intesto-Guard believes all pets can benefit from a daily PPA supplement no matter the circumstances. Similar to humans, the gut is the largest immune organ in the body and contains approximately 70% of all immune cells. Thus, keeping a healthy balance of good and bad bacteria is vital for your pet's overall well-being as well as providing them with adequate protection against a variety of diseases. Supplementing your pet's diet with PPAs can make all the difference in the world between living with a chronically ill pet and a healthy pet. A PPA supplement, such as Intesto-Guard, is an easy step to add to your pet's daily routine and diet that can significantly improve their quality of life and keep them happy and active for years to come. Intesto-Guard cleans and protects the GI tract leading to improved nutrient absorption, more energy and better health overall. The vet-formulated product comes in two forms, powder and paste, and is made up of all-natural ingredients that taste great to pets. It is safe to use daily and can be conveniently sprinkled on top of food. However, PPAs alone cannot repair an unstable gut microbiome. Instead, they work best alongside a healthy, balanced diet rich in fibers and nutrients as well as regular exercise. All of this together promotes optimal wellness for your pet. Intesto-Guard's PPA formula has everything your pet needs to get well and stay well. Clinical trials are underway at Iowa State University's College of  Veterinary Medicine and The Ohio State University College of Veterinary Medicine to further evaluate the efficacy of Intesto-Guard, but the results and testimonials speak for themselves. Follow along on Facebook and Instagram and shop Intesto-Guard's products to provide the most comprehensive, natural protection against common diseases for your young and mature pets today! For more information, contact Intesto-Guard by phone/WhatsApp at 563-231-7999 or email info@intesto-guard.com. Your pet is a special family member deserving the best possible protection and care. Bowel infection is one of the most common causes of pet visits to the Vet. Pets are constantly licking their paws and many end up getting very sick or even dying from harmful organisms. Intesto–Guard™ helps to prevent illness and stimulates rapid recovery from Gastro Intestinal challenges. ORGANIC + NON-GMO + PPA PATENT",https://www.linkedin.com/company/intesto-guard%E2%84%A2

June 21, 2022, San Francisco, United States of America – NanoScent, a fragrance company based in the US and Croatia, launches a unique pet cologne & conditioner containing perfume nanocapsules that do not evaporate. The patent-pending formula enables the nanocapsules to only break when owners ""pet"" their dog or cat. After spraying the pet, when their coat is touched, the capsules break and disperse the fragrance in the air. This way, pets will smell fresher for much longer. Tests show that the pleasant scent lasts 13 times longer than any traditional spray. Through NanoScent’s process, the fragrance does not make contact directly with the pet's fur and skin (it's encapsulated inside the nanocapsules), ensuring the most pleasant experience for the pet because traditional fragrances might irritate them. NanoScent was also formulated to condition a pet's coat because too many products that make man’s best friend smell good will leave his skin dry. The product contains extra ingredients to nourish the skin and make the coat smooth and silky. The CBD line contains just the perfect amount of hemp seed oil, cold-pressed olive oil and glycerin and acts not only as a cologne but also as a moisturizer. NanoScent was designed and manufactured in Croatia by a team of scientists with decades of experience in the fragrance sector. Their formula is patent pending in the US and has already been patented in the EU. Visit www.nanotechscent.com to learn more about their products.

OutFox For Dogs,United States,"Walnut Creek,",CA,http://www.outfoxfordogs.com,-,"Peticular LLC d/b/a OutFox For Dogs produces the OutFox™ Field Guard, a patented, vinyl-coated mesh mask designed to protect your dogs eyes, ears, nose, and mouth from foxtails and grass seeds. Additional uses include preventing scavenging and keeping pesky insects away from a dog's face. The patented OutFox® Field Guard is designed to help protect dogs’ eyes, ears, and noses from barbed grass seed penetration. The Field Guard is also used to help prevent scavenging and to help protect from insects. The Field Guard was developed when Diane Kostelec, an avid hiker, sought a solution to protect her dogs from the harmful injuries caused by foxtails while out on thier adventures. Leveraging her technical design experiences, Diane knew the answer would be a product that would shield her dog's faces and act as a barrier against pesky grass awns. With her top priority to make the mask as comfortable as possible for dogs, Diane designed every aspect of the Field Guard with meticulous care and detail - from the color to the material to the form. The color was chosen because black is the easiest color for dogs to see through. The material was chosesn because of its airy, lightweight composition and the fact that it complies with California Proposition 65 and the FDA and children’s toy standards. Specifically, each Field Guard is free from harmful phthalates, lead, and other banned heavy metals, which means that the Field Guard is safe for dogs to breathe through and if chewed on. In addition, the material used by the Field Guard is tested to be both bacteria and fungus-resistant. It also has the added benefit of acting as a sunshade for dogs with sensitive eyes or skin conditions as it has been shown to block 60% of UVA and UVB rays. With respect to the form, careful consideration was taken to make sure that mask would not be abrasive and would be unnoticeable to the dog while placed on its head. The shape provides for constant air circulation and the elasticized opening makes it easy for owners to slip the Field Guard on and off without having to adjust it every time. The OutFox® Field Guard is recommended by veterinarians as it has been shown to be a great prevention against foxtail penetration and as a solution for dogs with pica. To learn more, visit www.outfoxfordogs.com. The OutFox® Field Guard has appeared in The Bark and Rover. It is available online and at participating retailers.

Every ingredient in Pet Pasta has been whole-heartedly approved by both pets and vet nutritionists. We use all natural ingredients with vitamins and minerals, and we make sure everything is of the highest quality.  We simply refuse to sacrifice any nutritional value for cheaper ingredients. There is a touch of natural smoke flavoring to give it a drool worthy taste of bacon. You can add it to anything your dog prefers whether that is raw or cooked chicken, beef, pork, or salmon, etc. The rest of the nutrients are in the pasta! Follow the recipes on our website petpasta.com for complete and balanced meals and you never have to worry about your dog not getting the nutrition they need. As we say in our tagline: The pawstabilities are endless! Below is our ingredient list so you can see exactly what makes Pet Pasta so healthy and such a fantastic addition to your dog’s home cooked meals. Ingredients: Oats Oats are a great alternative carbohydrate for dogs that may be sensitive to wheat or grains. Oatmeal contains vitamin B to help maintain a healthy coat and linoleic acid, a type of omega-6 fatty acid, to maintain healthy skin. Oats are also a great source of soluble fiber, which can help regulate blood glucose levels and improve bowel movements. Eggs Eggs are high in protein and fatty acids. They also contain folate, riboflavin, selenium, vitamin A and vitamin B12. All of these are good for your dog’s skin and coat. Flaxseed Flaxseed is one of the richest plant sources of omega-3 fatty acid, also called a-linolenic acid. They can aid in constipation relief, help increase the quality of their coat and skin, and aid in a healthy immune system. Vitamin and Mineral Mix A mix that has been formulated by a veterinarian and calculated for inclusion in Pet Pasta by a vet nutritionist to ensure all the vitamins and trace minerals dogs need to balance a homemade diet. Brewer’s Yeast Brewer’s yeast is a high-quality source of essential amino acids and protein, which helps support lean muscle mass. It also contains B vitamins, which help convert the nutrients in your dog's food into energy he can use. Tapioca Flour Tapioca Flour is starch that has benefits similar to fiber, which can help support digestive health. We use it in our recipe because it is non-toxic gluten free, lectin free and it helps bind the pasta.  Tapioca can also be beneficial for dogs that are experiencing allergies and sensitivities. Cultured Skim Milk An excellent source of calcium and protein. It may help to establish and maintain beneficial intestinal bacterial flora and reduce lactose intolerance. Rosemary Extract It is an antimicrobial, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory that can help eliminate free radicals that can cause long-term damage. Including minimizing fat oxidation.",-

Stand out amongst the rest with the premium enhanced brand value of PetPak. Say goodbye to customers juggling multiple products to the checkout line. Say hello to the future of multipacking in the pet industry. Increase sales and amp customer convenience. Stand out amongst the rest with the premium enhanced brand value of PetPak. PakTech, a 31-year veteran in the sustainable packaging industry, announced its entry into the pet industry with the launch of its new subsidiary brand: PetPak. As more pet brands are realizing the benefits of multipacking, the future of pet product multipacking is set for exponential growth. Brands will need a way to stand out in the aisle and encourage consumers to pick up their product in bulk with ease. PetPak offers a sleek, sustainable option for pet industry brands using 100% recycled high-density polyethylene (HDPE) plastic to create recyclable packaging handles that let the product shine. “We are constantly looking for ways to innovate and deliver our sustainable solutions to broader industries, and the pet industry seemed like the perfect fit. Say goodbye to the struggle of juggling multiple pet products to the checkout line – PetPak delivers an easy way for brands to sell and for customers to carry multiple products with ease. PetPak brings years of successful industry expertise from parent company, PakTech. PakTech has a strong established portfolio and client base in the beverage, food and other CPG industries and is well recognized for its sustainability accolades. It’s our goal to carry our packaging proficiencies and sustainable advantages to the pet industry and create a future pet packaging trend with PetPak.” – says Director of Marketing, Elizabeth Kouns. With a minimal design that lets the product design take center stage, PetPak will provide an alternative multipacking solution that enhances brand value with a clean, premium look and feel to their products. Pet brands will also be able to choose from 31 unique color options and custom color, allowing them to find the perfect match to complement their brand. This simultaneously eliminates the need for unnecessary packaging that wraps around product detracting from the actual product design. Not only will products that use PetPak look premium, but their handles provide a customized fit for each product they are applied to, minimizing inventory loss – a common complication when using alternative secondary packaging options. This is a constructive step away from the commonly used shrink wrap, which is a single use material, obstructs a clear view of the product, and is prone to item slippage. Even worse, cardboard multipack options obscure the product entirely, easily fail when exposed to moisture and suffer significant environmental consequences adverse to what you might think. PetPak handles are made from 100% recycled HDPE, which is the same flexible, durable material used to make milk jugs, detergent bottles, and other household containers. HDPE is non-toxic, food safe, cost effective, and infinitely recyclable. This makes it a superior option for packaging, the planet, pet brands’ sustainability goals and budgets. “We believe that sustainable behavior is absolutely required to preserve and maintain our quality and diversity of life and the Earth’s ecosystems on which it depends,” says PetPak founder Jim Borg. Today, PetPak’s parent company serves major brands and emerging markets worldwide, thanks to their team of 300+ employees in Eugene, Oregon. PetPak is well-equipped and ready to deliver multipacking solutions to pet industry brands immediately and for years to come.

Together, the two New England businesses are launching a new pasture-raised, single-ingredient pet treat - Polkadog Pork Jerky. The new dog and cat treat will be launching for the first time at this year’s pet industry mega show, SuperZoo, and will be available for purchase Fall 2022. “We love everything about Walden Meat,” Polkadog’s founder Deb Suchman said. “Their South End shop, literally four blocks down the street, only sells pasture-raised meats from their small partner farms in New England and New York. Walden’s focus reconnects the local agricultural economy to companies like Polkadog, who work out of local kitchens and production facilities.” Walden Local Meat will be selling Polkadog Pork Jerky at their brick and mortar shop in the South End of Boston, plus the treat will also be available through their meat share program. “We are really excited for this partnership with Polkadog,” said Walden Local Meat’s Mike Leahy, the company’s head of brand and marketing, “It’s a fantastic way to create top-quality treats and help respect the entire animal our partner farmers raise. Truly a win for us all - furry friends included!” With a brand-new drying room nearly doubling their production capacity, Polkadog is also adding Wonder Nuggets Mini Tubes to their catalog of training treats. These pocket canisters are ideal for pet training, filled with a soft and chewy choice of Peanut Butter, Turkey and Cranberry, Beef and Sweet Potato, or Pork and Apple. The new kitchen expansion allows Polkadog increasing opportunities for sustainability projects and partnerships. “We’ve worked with small retailers across the country for two decades,” Suchman adds. “Each neighborhood has its own personality and its own needs, its own local flavor.  Celebrating and supporting those differences is the key to strong, healthy communities.” Polkadog’s Pork Jerky is the newest addition to Polkadog’s single-ingredient treat sticks, joining pet favorites like Chicken Strips and the original Polkadog Cod Skins. The company will be presenting their sustainable efforts and healthy treats at this year’s industry mega show, SuperZoo, happening August 23-25, 2022 in Las Vegas.

The Privy Kitty entrance comes with a vapor flap installed, but can be removed for any reason and for cleaning, by bending it and holding it at a 95° angle. There is a transitional Privy Kitty paw wiping mat in the portal passage from the inside to the outside. The Privy is a very clean and attractive way to have a cat in your house, because it removes the need to have a cat box sitting on the floor in the way to smell bad and trip over.  Privy Kitty Litter Station provides less bending, less odors, less dust to breath, less mess in the house, more floor space in the home, and a private retreat for kitty. Comes with complete instructions and two templates. When you're ready to rake and service the litter box, you go outside in the fresh air where the Privy has been placed on your exterior wall. Simply unlatch the lid and lift it to open position. While the lid is hooked safely in place, the owner can rake the droppings into a trash can, or bag, and then close the lid. The latch locks and cats cannot escape. The Privy is paintable, which may provide sun protection in higher temperatures. For cold times of the year, the box creates some insulation with it  space and the vapor flap barrier, but other measures may need to be taken during deep freezes. This product is great for mild temperatures and weather, although as mentioned in more extreme climates, other means may need to be addressed during the extreme times of the year. When selecting the location of the Privy, one needs to consider the framing and possible obstructions inside the wall, and the area on the outside of the house to have room for the Privy to mount and for the lid to be raised in place and hooked for daily litter raking. The inside of the litter box is roomy enough for cats to enter, turn around, and exit. The vapor flap is clear and flexible, but heavy enough to help insulate. The Privy Kitty can be installed by the owner if they are a good DIY candidate, but we recommend hiring a licensed contractor or handyman. The instructions are thorough, and comes with two templates. It is fun to seek out the right location for the luxurious Privy Kitty, and it is so wonderful to rid the house of the litter box taking up space in the home. Privy Kitty owners say, ""I can’t believe they haven't invented this sooner, it is the greatest!""",-

Pure Cravings is creating a new standard for pet food with our mission to protect cats from mercury.  From the makers of Safe Catch mercury-tested seafood for humans, Pure Cravings was developed as an innovative new product to solve the mercury problem in fish-based pet food using proprietary technology to hand-test 10,000 Tuna, Salmon, Sardines and Mackerel every day for levels of mercury, only approving fish containing 0.07 ppm or lower for inclusion in our recipes. Mercury levels vary fish-by-fish. Two fish from the same school, of the same size can vary in mercury by 10X. Pure Cravings testing each and every fish/catch is the only way to guarantee the purity of the product our cats are eating.  There are currently no government standards for heavy metals in pet food; as a result, pet food can be up to 670 times higher in heavy metals than human food.

RESET's newest advancement features lab-tested, premium traceable ingredients to ensure potency, purity, and consistency. Designed for maximum bioavailability, the Pet CBD drops are available in a pet-approved Pumpkin flavor to keep tails wagging! AUSTIN, Texas -- RESET Bioscience, an advanced wellness company that uses pharmaceutical-grade ingredients and technologies, introduces Pet CBD Drops to their portfolio. Developed by leading Ph.D. scientists, RESET Pet CBD Drops are the world's first water-based, ingestible CBD for pets featuring Powered by Santé® Delivery Technology for rapid, maximum absorption and are double-tested to human standards. The same lipid-encapsulation technology used to pioneer RESET's wellness products is now being applied to pet products. RESET's highly bioavabile drops can be conveniently added to your pet's food, favorite treat, or even to it's water bowl with no separation since the formula is water-based. ""As a proud dog mom, my pets are an extension of my family and their health and wellness is of utmost importance,"" says Ashley Ferguson, President of RESET. ""I wanted to use  pet CBD treats to support my elderly Chihuahua's quality of life and calm down my anxious Doberman puppy at home. Before RESET's launch, I was testing treats and oils from big brands readily available in the market at a leading analytical laboratory. I was beyond shocked and disappointed to find alarming amounts of heavy metals including lead, mercury and even arsenic, residual solvents and microbiological contamination like E. coli and Salmonella in almost every product. The dosing suggestions from other companies also didn't make sense to me. I couldn't believe I was being recommended to dose my Chihuahua the same amount as my Doberman! We immediately felt compelled to put out a pet product using human-grade ingredients, protected with our best-in-class testing and saw the opportunity to apply RESET's delivery system, in partnership with Powered by Santé® Delivery Technology. The technology differentiates RESET Pet by offering faster, better absorption for more immediate results and safer dosing in line with a pet's weight. With this water based formula, pet parents can have peace of mind with each dosage whereas with oils, you risk liver toxicity because oil is not well processed through little livers. We are constantly focused on the next generation of wellness and are proud to extend that to animal health."" Cats and dogs, like humans, can take full advantage of the interaction between CBD and the endocannabinoid system. Because of this, CBD can have positive effects on everything from mood and supporting mind and body to overall wellness. RESET is thrilled to be able to provide e-commerce shoppers with award-winning CBD relief for their furry friends. RESET's newest advancement features premium traceable ingredients that are lab-tested to ensure potency, purity and consistency. Designed for maximum bioavailability, the Pet CBD drops are available in a pet-approved Pumpkin flavor to keep tails wagging! About RESET Pet CBD Drops: RESET Pet CBD drops can be added to your pet's water, food, or favorite treat but RESET suggests avoiding dropper contact with snoots. With easy-to-use dosing based on pet weight, pet parents can feel confident in the amount of CBD given to their pets.

Shameless Pets,United States,"Chicago,",IL,http://www.shamelesspets.com,-,"Shameless Pets focuses on upcycling foods - the sustainable solution to rescue and transform misfit and surplus produce into high quality treats for your pets. Shameless Pets focuses on upcycling foods - the sustainable solution to rescue and transform misfit and surplus produce into high quality treats for your pets. Chicago, IL – Shameless Pets creates delicious treats for cats and dogs out of ingredients that would have otherwise been wasted - also known as upcycling. From a farmer’s leftover pumpkin after Halloween, apple pulp from a cider press, or ugly sweet potatoes that don’t make it onto the grocery shelves, Shameless Pets is able to turn these nutritional ingredients into tasty treats. Founder and CEO, James Bellow says, “Our story began when I was working as a corporate buyer at Target. I witnessed first-hand the vast amount of food that would go unused in stores every week. I wondered how big of an issue this food waste was and couldn’t believe what I found out – in the US alone, over 63 million tons of food gets tossed out every year. If that wasn’t crazy enough, global food wase accounts for 8% of greenhouse gas emissions! I knew I needed to do something about this, and so Shameless Pets was born.” Shameless Pets prioritizes working with North American suppliers to find creative, sustainable solutions to transform foods that would otherwise go to waste. According to several sources, preventing food waste is the single greatest solution to fighting climate change. As important, these real ingredients are packed with nutrients, making Shameless Pets cat and dog treats not only taste delicious, but also packing a health boost for pets.  Each flavor comes with a unique health benefit to keep pets at their best. Upcycled ingredients go through rigorous protocols and testing to ensure they’re of the highest quality before bringing them home and living a best second life as Shameless Pets treats. Recently, Shameless Pets announced their certification by The Upcycled Certified Program, the world’s first third party certification program for upcycled food ingredients and products. Although upcycling foods is central to Shameless Pets’ mission, the company takes a holistic approach to sustainability, with all packaging made with 25% of post-consumer recyclable (PCR) plastic, and 80% of product line made with solar-energy. About Shameless Pets During dinner one night, after James’ dog, Mina, had been begging for their leftovers, he had the “lightbulb” moment: he could rescue unused ingredients and turn them into healthy dog treats that Mina and her pals would love to devour. There was just one problem - James had no clue how to make dog treats! Serendipitously, he met Alex at a startup event who also shared a passion for the environment, was a dog lover AND a food scientist. Alex whipped up four tasty treat flavors that were all natural, grain free and boosted with superfoods to provide health benefits while utilizing upcycled ingredients! Shameless Pets Launches New Treats for the Holidays Upcycled Dog Treats – Joy on a Mission Chicago, IL – Shameless Pets, the pet treat brand that upcycles nutritious ingredients into high quality pet treats, is proud to announce their holiday launches. Santa’s Yelpers and Hump of Coal for pups, and Tasty Tinsel and Kitty Cane for feline friends. Fans of Shameless Pets will know that the company focuses on upcycling foods, the sustainable solution to transform misfit or surplus produce into high quality pet treats. *To date, Shameless Pets has upcycled over 1,170,055 lbs of food! Whether your best furry friend has been naughty or nice this year, Shameless Pets has the perfect gift for him or her: Santa’s Yelpers is for the those on Santa’s nice list. It’s the perfect blend of peppermint, yogurt, and upcycled sunflower seeds that is sure to keep pups begging for more. A puppy friendly twist on candy canes, this is the gift to give all of your furry friends this holiday! Hump of Coal is for those on Santa’s naughty list. Now, we at Shameless Pets know that there really is no such thing as a “naughty” pet, but for those that might have eaten out of the trash a few too many times or unrolled your toilet paper on a regular basis, etc., we have the perfect treat for them. Hump of Coal may not sound delicious, but it is! Full of carob, peanut butter, and upcycled sunflower seeds, even those on the naughty list will be gifted a tasty treat. Don’t forget the kitties! Kitty Cane is for your nice kitty! If you made it the whole year with a purrfect kitty who ate all their veggies & patiently waited for your attention, then fill their stockings up with Kitty Cane - a cranberry and chicken treat. Tasty Tinsel is for your feline friend who was extra catty this year (we’re talking jumping on countertops & clawing on furniture catty). This combo of white fish and pumpkin is the perfect treat for a naughty kitty. “Once we hear of new flavors or ingredients dogs or cats love, we are off and running to develop an upcycled supply chain to turn those ingredients into a healthy and delicious treat. While some make it into our permanent product lines, others become a way to celebrate holidays or special times of the year with your pets, while doing good for the planet,” says James Bello, co-founder and CEO of Shameless Pets. From 2019-2021, the company has grown tremendously at a CAGR of nearly 300%, proving that sustainable and healthy pet treats that dogs and cats love are resonating strongly with pet owners. Consumers can find Shameless Pets treats at retailers nationwide as well as at shamelesspets.com. All Shameless Pets treats are grain-free (no corn, soy, wheat), contain no artificial flavors, and are proudly made in the USA. Shameless Pets Rescues Unused Ingredients and Turns Them into Healthy Treats Shameless Pets focuses on upcycling ingredients from agricultural production, post-harvest leftovers, and food processing. Imagine a farmer’s leftover pumpkins after Halloween, apple pulp from a cider press, or ugly sweet potatoes that don't make it to retail shelves. In the case of Shameless Pets treats, this unused food becomes an ingredient that is highly nutritious and ridiculously tasty. You’re not only giving your furry friend something extra special, but you’ll be helping the planet as Shameless Pets crafts healthy and delicious pet treats with a twist – a positive impact on the planet that requires nothing in return! About Shameless Pets In 2017 the folks behind Shameless Pets, James and Alex, challenged themselves to bring value to the imperfect and surplus ingredients currently left out of our food system. They were pretty shaken up when they earned how much nutritious food gets tossed out in the country… literal tons of it! After quite a bit of experimentation, they created a line of treats for dogs that taste incredible, make our furry friends feel great, and upcycle nutritious ingredients that would have otherwise been wasted. Since then, they’ve added 3 new lines of dog treats and cat treats to the mix. This is just the beginning for Shameless Pets. They’re going to divert more and more of those overlooked ingredients into joyful moments, with a goal of upcycling 3 million lbs of food by 2025. Meanwhile, they’ll continue to develop recipes to make you and your pet’s life easier, more fun, and much more tasty! For More Information Visit: www.ShamelessPets.co",-

Hot Spots and other skin problems can have many causes....bug bites, food allergies, allergies to airborne substances. But regardless of the initial cause, the dog will typically react by licking, biting, and scratching the area which only makes things worse. CBD is known to have soothing and healing properties for the skin. In addition to CBD, we also use other great natural ingredients that soothe the skin like Raspberry Seed Oil, Coconut Oil, Calendula Oil, and Sunflower Lecithin. Once a dog gets a skin problem, they often will start licking the area frequently. Unfortunately, this often makes the problem worse. The licking keeps the area moist, which can exacerbate the problem and cause moist dermatitis. So we use a strong, but natural, bittering agent to stop or reduce the licking.",-

Come & visit us for a chat! #6669 Easier for Your Customer| Better for Their Dog | Better for the Planet Founded in New Zealand in 2010, WashBar quickly grew to become the number 1 pioneering natural grooming brand in New Zealand.  The brand is produced in NZ sourcing many local NZ ingredients from curated suppliers, such as manuka and kanuka oils, beeswax and lavender, ultimately supporting small communities around the country. Our specialty manuka and kanuka oils draw on the benefits and growing consumer knowledge of New Zealand Manuka Honey.  Antibacterial and antimicrobial properties of the oils assist with solving everyday itching, and are gentle enough to be used on even sensitive skin.  Antimicrobial claims are backed by scientific research. 100% natural ingredients.  Paraben free. Alcohol free. Sulphate free. Vegan. Cruelty free. Tested on humans, not animals. Solid bars are easier to use to wash your dog than a liquid shampoo, allow for easy application across the entire body, and the lighter lather makes it easier to rinse, reducing the likelihood of soaps residue creating hotspots. Sustainability Merchandising Packaging Design and Aesthetic The WashBar packaging design reflects the company’s approach to the formulations.  Simple, pared back and honest.  No nasties, just the good stuff.  A pet parent picks up the vibe from the packaging, which is clean, natural and unfussy. The bar is curve shaped to make for easier use.  The underneath curve fits nicely against the curves of the animal’s skin and the upper curve allows the bar to fit easily in your hand to make for a more enjoyable washing experience for both dog and pet parent. Product Detail Original Soap for Dogs delivers a fantastic yet gentle everyday clean. Manuka WashBar is formulated with more Manuka and Kanuka oils to assist pets with skin that needs a little more help from their shampoo. Quality of Life WashBar facilitates the love between a pet and their human.  A clean dog with healthy skin and paws is much more likely to be out enjoying adventures in the great outdoors with their human. Some dogs love to lick so the WashBar ingredients are non-toxic and safe for dogs.  Even if your dog eats the soap, they are unlikely to suffer nothing more than an upset tummy and no lasting ill effects.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/louise-knight-9aa0a015b/

The Whitebridge brand portfolio includes Tiki Cat®, Tiki Dog™, Cloud Star®, Petite Cuisine®, Buddy Biscuits®, Dogswell®, Pet Botanics®,  Crazy Dog® and Grizzly®. ST LOUIS – July 12, 2022 – When Whitebridge Pet Brands merged with Italian-based Agras Pet Foods in April 2022, the US manufacturer took a major leap toward its goal of building a global natural pet health and nutrition company. Agras’s natural Schesir® brand dog and cat food was viewed as a perfect complement to Whitebridge’s treat, food and supplement brands, including Tiki Pets®, Cloud Star®, Dogswell®, Crazy Dog®, Pet Botanics® and Grizzly®.  Italian brands Stuzzy® and Adoc®, further amplified their position in the EU.  The combined entity, which continues to operate under the Whitebridge Pet Brands name, has a substantially enlarged international footprint, with four plants and sales in more than fifty countries. To signify the Whitebridge-Agras union, a striking new corporate logo has been designed, combining the best of the two companies’ well-recognized previous logos.  The new design features the name “Whitebridge Pet Brands” incorporated into the layout and colors of the former Agras logo, with its iconic square of blue, red, green and tan rosette-like shapes. “It’s really all about the pets, so an important consideration for me was the incorporation of both a dog and cat silhouette into the new logo,” said Matt Grant, Graphic Designer at Whitebridge. “Whitebridge’s philosophy has always been, ‘Better Together.’ The merger with Agras, which shares our mission of delivering natural and minimally processed pet food takes the synergies of working together to a whole new level.  New global capabilities for innovation, expanded distribution and growth, allow us to fulfill our promise of keeping pets happy and healthy, thereby doing the same for their people,” said Ann Hudson, Vice President of Marketing of Whitebridge Pet Brands. #       #       # About: Whitebridge Pet Brands was founded in January 2015 with the merger of Cloud Star, a leading pet treat manufacturer and Petropics, maker of Tiki Cat® and Tiki Dog® pet foods. In April 2017, Whitebridge Pet Brands acquired Dogswell®, a leading brand of functional jerkies for dogs. In January 2020, the company acquired Cardinal Pet Care, maker of Pet Botanics® and Crazy Dog® training treats. And in March 2021, Whitebridge Pet Brands completed the acquisition of Grizzly Pet Products, a leader in pet supplements. Whitebridge Pet Brand’s goal is to build a global natural pet health nutrition company that brings health and happiness to pets and owners with a range of minimally processed, natural, and wholesome dog and cat foods, treats, complements, and supplements. Whitebridge Pet Brands is headquartered in St. Louis, Missouri and has manufacturing operations in Joplin, Missouri, Woodinville, Washington and Copenhagen, Denmark. Agras Pet Foods was founded in 1986 in Genoa, Italy, with the mission to bring natural and high-quality products to the pet food sector and is today a leader in Europe in the distribution of natural foods for dogs and cats, with a particular focus on the wet manufacturing operations in Neive, Italy. ST. LOUIS, September 30th, 2021 -- Tiki Cat® has launched a new range of food products that will help kitties get started on the right paw. New Tiki Cat® Baby™ offers lifestage nutrition formulated to meet the complex dietary requirements of kittens ranging in age from newborn to 12 months. The line features 4 new formulas aligned with young felines’ developing nutritional and digestive needs, taking them from nursing to weaning to eating whole foods on their own.  The Tiki Cat Baby range complements the existing Tiki Cat mousse for kittens and includes: TIKI CAT® BABY™ THRIVE -- An innovative easy-to-lick liquid energy supplement for kittens ages newborn and up that are underweight or losing weight. Formulated so that even the youngest baby kitties can consume and digest it, Tiki Cat Baby Thrive is high in protein from real chicken, liver and easily digestible egg. It contains 28% fat and 25 calories in each tiny packet to promote healthy weight gain and increase energy among the littlest carnivores. TIKI CAT® BABY™ MOUSSE & SHREDS – For kittens 4 weeks and older, Baby Mousse & Shreds is formulated to help transition from mother’s milk. The perfect starter food for weaning kittens, its delicate layers of mousse and finely shredded poultry are easy on tiny teeth and gums, while easy-to-digest liver and egg is appealing to eat and is gentle on young tummies. Added prebiotics further aid digestion. The formula also includes supplemental taurine and balanced calcium and phosphorus to support healthy development during early growth, as well as DHA for brain development. Tiki Cat Baby Mousse & Shreds is available in a tasty Chicken, Salmon & Chicken Liver Recipe. TIKI CAT® BABY™ CHICKEN & SALMON RECIPE and TIKI CAT® BABY™ CHICKEN & EGG RECIPE These two formulas are whole foods recipes that provide complete nutrition for kittens from 8 weeks to 1 year. Ultra-high in protein and fat, these wet foods provide extra hydration to support growing carnivores. DHA promotes healthy brain development, and added taurine assures young felines get enough of this essential amino acid. “Kittens under 1 year make up 13% of the cat population (Packaged Facts), and these babies have very specialized nutritional needs,” said Ann Hudson, Vice President of Marketing for Tiki Pets®.  “To support their rapid growth, kittens need more energy from fat, protein building blocks, prebiotics and appropriately balanced ratios of calcium and phosphorous. “A kitten’s diet also must be more nutrient dense, because tiny stomachs can’t hold as much food,” added Hudson. “The Tiki Cat Baby range has been formulated to meet these requirements, while being made with delicious real proteins like chicken and salmon that will entice young kitties to eat.” Tiki Cat® Baby™ Thrive is available in Chicken & Chicken Liver Recipe, with an MSRP of $9.99 for a pouch of 20 .28-oz. servings. Tiki Cat® Baby™ Mousse & Shreds is available at $4.99 MSRP for a pack of 3 1.9-oz. cans. Tiki Cat® Baby™ Chicken & Salmon has an MSRP of $1.69 per 2.4-oz. can. Tiki Cat® Baby™ Chicken & Egg has an MSRP of $1.69 per 2.4-oz. can.
